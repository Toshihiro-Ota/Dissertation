\section{Surface defects as transfer matrices}

In this section, we mainly review the results in \cite{Maruyoshi:2016caf}, in which the correspondence we introduce in the previous section appears. 







\subsection{Brane tilings and integrable lattice models}









\subsubsection{Supersymmetric index and integrable lattice models}








\subsubsection{Integrable lattice models from quiver gauge theories}








\subsection{Surface defects in $A_1$ theories of class $\mathcal S$}








\subsubsection{Surface defects and L-operators}









\subsubsection{Surface defects as transfer matrices}
