\section{Surface defects as transfer matrices}

In this section, we mainly review the results in [Maruyoshi-Yagi], in which the correspondence we introduce in the previous section appears. 







\subsection{Brane tilings and integrable lattice models}

\subsubsection{Integrable lattice models from quiver gauge theories}








\subsection{Surface defects in $A_{1}$ theories of class $\mathcal{S}$}








\subsubsection{Surface defects and L-operators}
