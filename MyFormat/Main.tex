\begin{abstract}
I would like to acknowledge kind support and help from many people,
without those this thesis would not have been completed.
Firstly, I would like to thank my Ph.D.~advisor Koji Hashimoto
who has given me great opportunity to start my study of string theory at Osaka university.
In particular, in the first three years of my Ph.D.~program I could learn
a lot of things through discussion and collaboration with him.
I owe deep gratitude to my collaborators Kazunobu Maruyoshi and Junya Yagi.
This thesis is largely based on the joint work with them,
and I have been enjoying discussion and chat with them every time.
They brought me to the fascinating subject at the intersection of supersymmetric gauge theory,
string theory, and integrable system.
I am also grateful to Yasuhiro Akutsu, Norihiro Iizuka, Tetsuya Onogi and Satoshi Yamaguchi
for careful reading of this thesis and giving me useful comments.

I would like to say how much of a pleasure it has been being a member of iTHEMS at RIKEN.
In particular, I really appreciate Tetsuo Hatsuda, who is the director of iTHEMS, and Masato Taki,
who was a member of iTHEMS and is also my collaborator on machine learning.
Their advice, encouragement, and arrangement were always helping me a lot during my stay at iTHEMS.
Over the past two years, I have been really benefited from stimulating discussions with
colleagues in various fields of science at iTHEMS.
Such an experience has made my Ph.D.~course quite fruitful and way more enjoyable.
I am especially indebted to mathematicians at iTHEMS; Hokuto Konno, Genki Ouchi,
Kenta Sato and Masaki Taniguchi for communicating with and telling me lots of mathematical ideas.
Inspiring discussions and interesting conversation with them were a great help of this thesis.

I would like to thank Tomoko Iwanami, Chikako Ota and Hitomi Wada, the secretaries at iTHEMS,
and Mika Umetani and Satomi Suzuki, the secretaries of the particle physics theory group
at Osaka university for arranging a lot of procedures so that I could do my research at RIKEN.
They were always kind and I was helped many times.
During my Ph.D.~study, I have been supported in part by RIKEN Junior Research Associate program and
by JSPS fellowships for Young Scientists.
Finally, I wish to thank my parents for their understanding, love and constant support.
