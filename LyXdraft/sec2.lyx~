\begin_layout Section
Integrability from extra dimensions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Throughout this paper, we would like to discuss correspondences between
 a certain class of supersymmetric gauge theories and integrable lattice
 models: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{I}_{\mathsf{T}_{4d}\left[\mathsf{L}_{2d}\right]}=Z_{\mathsf{L}_{2d}\left[\mathsf{T}_{4d}\right]},
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where the left-hand side is the supersymmetric index of a four-dimensional
 gauge theory 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathsf{T}_{4d}$
\end_inset

 and the right-hand side denotes the statistical partition function of the
 corresponding integrable lattice model 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathsf{L}_{2d}$
\end_inset

 specified by the four-dimensional theory 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathsf{T}_{4d}$
\end_inset

.
 As it turns out, the correspondence emerges from TQFT with extra dimensions
 [Yagi].
 The aim of this section is to give the step-by-step explanation of the
 above correspondence from an elementary level.
 Besides, to explain these, we will start by clarifying in order what the
 terms TQFT, lattice model, and integrability mean.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Preliminaries
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the next subsection, we would like to introduce lattice model as discrete
 quantum field theory (QFT).
 So let us start from the general settings of QFT.
 We first briefly review one-dimensional QFT, which is nothing but quantum
 mechanics, and then extend the discussion to general quantum field theory
 in (
\begin_inset Formula $d+1$
\end_inset

)-dimensions.
 Though we do not have a complete definition of general QFT, a special class
 of QFT which is called 
\emph on
topological
\emph default
 QFT is axiomatized by Atiyah [Atiyah].
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
What is quantum field theory?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us now begin with one-dimensional QFT, as known as quantum mechanics
 (QM).
 Suppose we have a one-dimensional manifold
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Throughout the paper, we assume all the manifold is smooth and oriented,
 unless otherwise stated.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

, which may be thought of as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $M^{1}=$
\end_inset

 interval or 
\begin_inset Formula $S^{1}$
\end_inset

 (or 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

), and the data to specify the QM: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}$
\end_inset

 : a vector space (Hilbert space/state space), 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{O}$
\end_inset

 : a set of self-adjoint operators (observables, acting on 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}$
\end_inset

),
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 : an operator called 
\emph on
Hamiltonian
\emph default
, 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $H\in\mathcal{O}$
\end_inset

 and the state space 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}$
\end_inset

 is a finite or infinite dimensional 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{C}$
\end_inset

-vector space.
 We sometimes need to consider a set of operators 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{O}$
\end_inset

 including not self-adjoint operators, but for simplicity we do not care
 about that at this moment.
 In undergraduate, we have learnt that one should consider the Schrodinger
 equation and find a good basis in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}$
\end_inset

 diagonalizing the Hamiltonian.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Formally, the procedure of solving the Schrodinger equation leads to an
 expression of time evolution of states by a linear map

\end_layout

\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{-tH}$
\end_inset

 in quantum mechanics, and the partition function in many-body statistical
 mechanics.
 In turn, we have two most crucial properties of QM: Given an interval 
\begin_inset Formula $M^{1}=\left[t_{0},t_{1}\right]$
\end_inset

, we have state vectors at the endpoints of the interval and a time evolution
 between the states: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
e^{-\left(t_{1}-t_{0}\right)H}:\mathcal{H}\longrightarrow\mathcal{H},
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 and given a circle 
\begin_inset Formula $M^{1}=S_{\beta}^{1}$
\end_inset

, we get a number called 
\emph on
partition function

: 
\emph on

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{Tr}_{\mathcal{H}}e^{-\beta H}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

\end_layout

\end_inset

In addition, from the physical facts it is quite reasonable to assume that
 the time evolution and the partition function are compatible with cutting
 and gluing intervals and 
\begin_inset Formula $S^{1}$
\end_inset

s.
 This simply means that the time evolution from time 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{0}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{1}$
\end_inset

 followed by another time evolution from 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{1}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{2}$
\end_inset

 is equal to the single time evolution from 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{0}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{2}$
\end_inset

, etc.
 Summarizing, the properties that quantum mechanics or one-dimensional QFT
 has are rephrased by the language of given one-dimensional manifold 
\begin_inset Formula $M^{1}$
\end_inset

: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Given an interval, produces state vectors at the endpoints and a linear
 map between them.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Given an 
\begin_inset Formula $S^{1}$

\begin_layout Itemize

\begin_inset Formula $S^{1}$
\end_inset

s.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus, in the abstract we conclude that one-dimensional QFT, or quantum mechanics
, is a gadget satisfying the above properties for each given one-dimensional
 manifold 
\begin_inset Formula $M^{1}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From these observations of quantum mechanics, we wish to extend the discussion
 to general (
\begin_inset Formula $d+1$
\end_inset

)-dimensional QFT.
 The starting point of defining a (
\begin_inset Formula $d+1$
\end_inset

)-dimensional QFT is the choice of a (
\begin_inset Formula $d+1$
\end_inset

)-dimensional manifold 
\begin_inset Formula $M^{d+1}$
\end_inset

, which has 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 spatial directions and one 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

time
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 direction.
 For most QFTs the manifold 
\begin_inset Formula $M^{d+1}$
\end_inset

 is viewed as a Riemannian manifold with a smooth metric on it.
 As already noticed, we will mostly consider a positive definite Riemannian
 metric, QFT on which is usually referred to as an Euclidean QFT, and hence
 precisely there is no notion of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

time
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in such a theory, at least globally.
 The manifold 
\begin_inset Formula $M^{d+1}$
\end_inset

 may or may not have boundaries.
 In case it does have boundaries some additional information is needed at
 the boundaries to define the QFT.
 In addition to a Riemannian metric, depending on the situation one wants
 to consider, one often needs some more structures on the manifold 
\begin_inset Formula $M^{d+1}$
\end_inset

, e.g.
 smooth structure, conformal structure, spin structure, etc.

To obtain the data to specify a QFT, we now would like to extend the observation

 Suppose we have a (

 has a boundary 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
Z\left(M^{d+1}\right)\in\mathcal{H}_{bdy},
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 and should produce a number when

 has no boundary 
\begin_inset Formula

\end_inset

In the case of 
\begin_inset Formula $M^{d+1}$
\end_inset

 with a boundary, the vector space defined on the boundary is called the
 space of states or just Hilbert space in the physics literature.
 On the one hand, if 
\begin_inset Formula $M^{d+1}$
\end_inset

 does not have boundary, the number 
\begin_inset Formula $Z\left(M^{d+1}\right)$
\end_inset

 is called the partition function.
 If the boundary of 
\begin_inset Formula $M^{d+1}$
\end_inset

 has several disconnected components, namely the boundaries are given by
 the disjoint union of simply connected 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

-dimensional closed manifolds 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ N_{i}^{d}\right\} $
\end_inset

: 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial M^{d+1}=\sqcup_{i}N_{i}^{d}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $Z$
\end_inset

 should define a linear map among the vector spaces defined on the boundaries.
 In particular, in the case 
\begin_inset Formula $M^{d+1}=N^{d}\times I$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $I$
\end_inset

 is an interval of length 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $M^{d+1}$
\end_inset

 has two boundaries 
\begin_inset Formula $N^{d}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Z$
\end_inset

 now gives rise to a linear map 
\begin_inset Formula $Z\left(N^{d}\times I\right)=:U\left(T\right)$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
U\left(T\right):\mathcal{H}_{N}\longrightarrow\mathcal{H}_{N}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 By physical facts, 
\begin_inset Formula $Z$
\end_inset

 also should be compatible with cutting and gluing of (
\begin_inset Formula $d+1$
\end_inset

)-dimensional manifolds, and thus we learn that the linear map given above
 satisfies 
\begin_inset Formula $U\left(T_{1}\right)U\left(T_{2}\right)=U\left(T_{1}+T_{2}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 This in turn defines an operator 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 as the generator of 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
U\left(T\right)=\exp\left(-TH\right).
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 is called the Hamiltonian of the system, acting on the space of states
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}_{N}$
\end_inset

.
 If one considers a Riemannian manifold with Lorentzian metric, 
\begin_inset Formula $U\left(T\right)$
\end_inset

 is represented as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
U\left(T\right)=\exp\left(-iTH\right),
\end{equation}

\end_inset

and then the interval 
\begin_inset Formula $I$
\end_inset

 is regarded as

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Construction of 
\begin_inset Formula $Z$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So far we have discussed only in an abstract way what quantum field theory
 is, or in other words what the gadget 
\begin_inset Formula $Z$
\end_inset

 should satisfy.
 Let us now see how we specify 
\begin_inset Formula $Z$
\end_inset

 to define a QFT.
 Broadly speaking, there are three kinds of constructions of 
\begin_inset Formula $Z$
\end_inset

.
 They are not totally independent and have many aspects of applicabilities.
 In the rest of this section, 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 denotes a (
\begin_inset Formula $d+1$
\end_inset

)-dimensional manifold with or without boundary, and 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 denotes a 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

-dimensional closed manifold without boundary.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Construct from the axiom
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first construction is in a sense the simplest one; we write down appropriate
 properties that a QFT must satisfy, and axiomatize them.
 Construction of 
\begin_inset Formula $Z$
\end_inset

 is to give a mathematical formulation which satisfy the axioms as the data
 to specify the theory.
 This is actually the only way that one can define a QFT by mathematically
 rigorous procedures.
 Normally, such a theory is first studied by physicists as an ideal or a
 toy model from the physical motivation, and then refined as rigorous mathematic
s by mathematicians.
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The fact that a QFT can be treated in a mathematically rigorous way implies
 that the theory may have an enormous amount of symmetry, and the difficulties
 of the QFT are completely controlled by them.
 Even better, these theories can often be exactly solved in an appropriate
 sense.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 There are several kinds of such theories.
 We now introduce typical three examples.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first one is 
\emph on
free theories
\emph default
 in any dimensions, which are toy models of field theories and play important
 roles as a probe of more complicated QFTs.
 In any spacetime dimensions, for the Riemannian manifolds with or without
 spin structure, we can rigorously define the free field theories.
 One of them is the free scalar field theory.
 Besides a (
\begin_inset Formula $d+1$
\end_inset

)-dimensional closed manifold 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

, pick a 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

-bundle 
\begin_inset Formula $P\rightarrow M$
\end_inset

 with connection 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and a 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

-vector space 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

.
 Then we construct the associated vector bundle 
\begin_inset Formula $P\times_{G}V$
\end_inset

, whose covariant derivative is denoted by 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{A}$
\end_inset

.
 We now have the Laplacian 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta_{A}$
\end_inset

 given by the covariant derivative 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{A}$
\end_inset

, and then the free scalar field theory is defined by the partition function
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
Z_{\mathrm{scalar}}\left(M;A\right):=1/\det\Delta_{A}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 If the determinant of the Laplacian involves a divergence, it must be properly
 removed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another free theory is the free fermion theory.
 In this case 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 also needs a spin structure and the spin representations 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $S'$
\end_inset

.
 Then we construct the Dirac operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{D}_{A}$
\end_inset

 on the spin bundles and the partition function of the free fermion theory
 is given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
Z_{\mathrm{fermion}}\left(M;A\right):=\det\mathcal{D}_{A},
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 again the determinant is taken appropriately.
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Fermion theories may have anomalies.
 If it is the case, the axiom needs to be somehow modified.
 In particular the partition function for a closed manifold is given by
 the eta invariant [Dai-Freed, Witten].
 
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, in two dimensions, we have another axiomatic quantum field theory,
 that is 
\emph on
conformal field theory
\emph default
 (CFT).
 Conformal field theory in two dimensions was originally formulated by Belavin,
 Polyakov, and Zamolodchikov [BPZ] as a model of physical systems at critical
 points.
 They established the renowned Virasoro algebra as an infinite dimensional
 symmetry of the system and fully investigated the minimal model.
 The holomorphic part of the Virasoro algebra is captured by vertex operator
 algebras, and since then there are many mathematically rigorous discussions
 on them.
 Their kinematic behaviors on Riemann surfaces are governed by the conformal
 blocks, and its geometric meaning has been studied in [Freed-Shenker].
 In turn, the study of irrational CFTs has led to the AGT correspondence
 [AGT], which has brought to us large amount of developments in both physics
 and mathematics.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The final example is 
\emph on
topological quantum field theories
\emph default
 (TQFTs).
 TQFT is one of the main focuses in this paper.
 These theories are originating from Witten's proposals of topological field
 theories [Witten TQFT, topological sigma, Jones-Witten].
 Inspired by Witten's proposals, Atiyah and Segal axiomatized the topological
 QFT,
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Precisely speaking, what Segal axiomatized is the definition of conformal
 field theories.
 However, at any rate the definition of CFT by Segal is quite similar to
 the definition of Atiyah's TQFT, i.e.
 it is a categorical one.
 For the geometric definition of CFT, see [Freed-Shenker].
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and happily this also has brought to us a numerous amount of applications
 both to physics and to pure mathematics.
 For example, (
\begin_inset Formula $1+1$
\end_inset

)-dimensional topological QFTs are known to be categorically equivalent
 to commutative Frobenius algebras.
 (
\begin_inset Formula $2+1$
\end_inset

)-dimensional Chern-Simons theory for a compact Lie group 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 is rigorously constructed by the Turaev-Viro and Reshetikhin-Turaev constructio
n using quantum groups, and has applications to knot or link invariants
 and 
\begin_inset Formula $3$
\end_inset

-manifold invariants.
 Moreover, both 2d and 3d TQFTs have applications to the mirror symmetry,
 or topological string theory, those have led to fruitful interactions between
 physics and mathematics.
 We will take more time for TQFT and introduce the Atiyah's axioms in some
 detail in the next subsection.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Path integrate the Boltzmann weight
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before going to Atiyah's TQFT axioms, let us see two more constructions
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $Z$
\end_inset

.
 These are no longer mathematically rigorous, but rather familiar constructions
 for physicists.
 The second construction is to define a partition function by 
\emph on
path integral
\emph default
.
 The general prescription is given as follows: One first introduces an action
 functional over the classical field configurations, which deduces the classical
 equation of motion by the variational principle.
 Then one exponentiates the action and integrate it over the space of fields.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The partition function for the free fields given above can also be defined
 by the path integral expression.
 For example, for the free complex scalar field theory consider a section
 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 of the vector bundle 
\begin_inset Formula $P\times_{G}V$
\end_inset

 over 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 is a representation of a compact Lie group 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

.
 Then define an action functional 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
S:\Gamma\left(P\times_{G}V\right)\longrightarrow\mathbb{R},
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 such that
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
S\left(\phi\right)=\int_{M}\frac{1}{2}D_{A}\phi\wedge\ast D_{A}\phi,
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $*$
\end_inset

 is the Hodge star on 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{A}$
\end_inset

 is again the covariant derivative given by the connection 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 Using this action functional, physicists 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

define
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 its partition function by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
Z_{\mathrm{scalar}}\left(M;A\right):=\int_{\Gamma\left(P\times_{G}V\right)}\mathcal{D}\phi\,e^{-S\left(\phi\right)}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The integrand 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{-S}$
\end_inset

 of path integral is generically called the 
\emph on
Boltzmann weight
\emph default
.
 For the free field theories, the path integral can be expressed as an infinite
 product of the Gaussian integral.
 Introducing an appropriate regularization, one can compute the exact partition
 function and it leads to the same result as mentioned above.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As another example, let us consider Yang-Mills theory.
 We now introduce the kinetic term of the connection 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

, and define the action functional 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
S\left(A\right)=\int_{M}\frac{1}{4g^{2}}F_{A}\wedge*F_{A},
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{A}$
\end_inset

 is the curvature of the 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

-connection 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 Define the partition function of Yang-Mills theory by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
Z_{\mathrm{YM}}\left(M\right)=\int_{\mathcal{A}_{M}/\mathcal{G}}\mathcal{D}A\,e^{-S\left(A\right)},
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where the integral is taken over the space of connections on 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 modulo gauge transformations.
 Unlike the free scalar theory, making this path integral mathematically
 precise is an extremely difficult problem.
 Although it is still ill-defined, physicists have been working on this
 expression to understand many properties of quantum gauge theories.
 Experimentally, physicists discretize the manifold 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 to a (
\begin_inset Formula $d+1$
\end_inset

)-dimensional lattice and put it on a supercomputer.
 At least, numerical calculations show the above construction may be a mathemati
cally meaningful and reproduce many experimental results to reasonable accuracy.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Deduce from string/M-theory
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The final construction of 
\begin_inset Formula $Z$

 is to use string or M-theory.
 This is also our main tool to construct a QFT to realize the correspondence
 (the first equation of this section).
 Nonetheless, string or M-theory is less rigorous than path-integral expression
 of the construction of 
\begin_inset Formula $Z$
\end_inset

, and thus it is more hopeless to give a mathematical precise meaning to
 the construction.
 We here would like to show just two examples which 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 a class of quantum field theories through string/M-theory.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second example is the so-called six-dimensional 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{N}=\left(2,0\right)$
\end_inset

 theories.
 We start from a 10-dimensional string theory called the type IIB string
 theory, which roughly speaking assigns the partition function 
\begin_inset Formula $Z_{\mathrm{IIB}}\left(\tilde{M}\right)$
\end_inset

 to a 10-dimensional manifold 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{M}$
\end_inset

.
 Pick a finite subgroup 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma_{G}$
\end_inset

 of SU(
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

) of type 
\begin_inset Formula $G=A_{n},\,D_{n}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{6,7,8}$
\end_inset

.
 We define a six-dimensional QFT 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{G}$
\end_inset

 by its partition function for a six-dimensional manifold 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
Z_{Q_{G}}\left(M\right)=Z_{\mathrm{IIB}}\left(M\times\mathbb{C}^{2}/\Gamma_{G}\right).
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 They are examples of six-dimensional 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{N}=\left(2,0\right)$
\end_inset

 superconformal QFTs.
 These theories are known not to have a Lagrangian description, namely their
 partition function cannot be obtained from the path integral formalism.
 They have another description via M-theory, as the low-energy dynamics
 of M5-branes.
 The construction from M5-branes leads to the AGT correspondence and the
 notion of class 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{S}$
\end_inset

 theories, which we will explain in later sections.

As mentioned some times, in this paper TQFT in extra dimensions will play
 a crucial role to realize the correspondence between supersymmetric gauge
 theories and integrable lattice models.
 So now let us pause here and introduce the Atiyah's axioms of TQFT.
 We first list the axioms, and right then give their physical meanings.
 Readers will notice that most of these axioms are physically quite natural
 and actually mathematical rephrasing of the properties that 
\begin_inset Formula $Z$
\end_inset

 should satisfy, which we have already seen.
 In addition, we would like to define lattice model as a discrete version
 of QFT in the next subsection.
 Reviewing the definitions of TQFT here will be really a good help of the
 argument of lattice model.

This corresponds to (a half of) canonical quantization, or geometric quantizatio
n, known in physics literature.
 Why we say it is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

a half of
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 will be explained in a moment.
 In physics, especially for a field theory which has a Lagrangian description,
 we consider the phase space of fields, take a constant-time surface, and
 then perform canonical quantization by imposing canonical commutation relations
 on fields and their conjugates.
 The constant-time surface is a codimension-1 hypersurface in (
\begin_inset Formula $d+1$
\end_inset

)-dimensional manifold 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

, which in this case is nothing but the 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

-dimensional closed manifold 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

.
 So, the manifold 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 is viewed as a collection of 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 spatial directions.
 One can think of the assigned vector space 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}_{N}$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the space of functionals on the classical fields on 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 usually called the space of states or just Hilbert space of the system.
 The only major difference here is that for topological theory the Hilbert
 space is of finite dimension.

One can remove the finiteness condition from the axiom.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This expresses the path integral quantization on 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 with boundary.
 Recall that if one has a spacetime manifold with boundary, one needs to
 impose a boundary condition on fields on the boundary, and it leads to
 the state vector associated to the boundary condition by path integral
 expression, namely let 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi$
\end_inset

 be a fixed field configuration on 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
Z\left(M;\varphi\right)=\int_{X\mid_{N}=\varphi}\mathcal{D}X\,e^{-S\left(X\right)}\,\in\mathcal{H}_{N}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 In other words, the quantum state at a generic time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 is given by the path integral of the Boltzmann weight over all the classical
 fields with time 
\begin_inset Formula $<t$
\end_inset

.

\begin_layout Standard
These data are subject to the following assignments: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
(involutory) Let 
\begin_inset Formula $-N$
\end_inset

 denote a manifold 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{H}_{-N}=\mathcal{H}_{N}^{*},
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}_{N}^{*}$
\end_inset

 is the dual to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}_{N}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $N$

-dimensional closed manifolds 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{2}$
\end_inset

, then the vector space associated on it is factorized to a tensor product:
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{H}_{N_{1}\sqcup N_{2}}=\mathcal{H}_{N_{1}}\otimes\mathcal{H}_{N_{2}}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 This is really natural in the physical point of view.
 This condition means that if we have two physical systems defined on spatially
 disjoint union 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{1}\sqcup N_{2}$
\end_inset

, then the space of states is represented as the tensor product of each
 state space.
 Also, from the conditions so far one finds that if (
\begin_inset Formula $d+1$
\end_inset

)-dimensional manifold 
\begin_inset Formula $M'$
\end_inset

 has two boundaries such that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\partial M'=-N_{1}\sqcup N_{2},
\end{equation}

\end_inset

then 
\begin_inset Formula $Z$
\end_inset

 defines a linear map
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
Z\left(M'\right)\in\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathbb{C}}\left(\mathcal{H}_{N_{1}},\mathcal{H}_{N_{2}}\right),
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 namely, for a cobordism between 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{2}$
\end_inset

, we have a linear map between 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}_{N_{1}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}_{N_{2}}$
\end_inset

.
 This defines a time evolution, or transition amplitude, between the states
 in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}_{N_{1}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}_{N_{2}}$
\end_inset

.
 When the field theory has a Hamiltonian, 
\begin_inset Formula $Z\left(M'\right)$
\end_inset

 may correspond to the time evolution operator 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
Z\left(M'\right):=e^{-tH}:\mathcal{H}_{N_{1}}\longrightarrow\mathcal{H}_{N_{2}}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Since canonical quantization is a procedure to make an assignment of Hilbert
 spaces and the time evolution on them, as we saw in QM, this association
 of linear maps gives the other half of canonical quantization.

 Suppose we have an initial state 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{0}\in\mathcal{H}_{N_{1}}$

\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}\in\mathcal{H}_{N_{2}}$

\end{align}

\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
K\left(\varphi_{t},\varphi_{0}\right)=\int_{X\mid_{N_{1}}=\varphi_{0}}^{X\mid_{N_{2}}=\varphi_{t}}\mathcal{D}X\,e^{-S\left(X\right)}.

\begin_inset Formula

 are glued along 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{2}$
\end_inset

 by a certain diffeomorphism on 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{2}$
\end_inset

 This asserts that the linear maps are transitive when we compose cobordisms.
 This is nothing but the physical requirement that the time evolution is
 compatible with the cutting and gluing the manifolds.

Given 
\begin_inset Formula $N=\emptyset$

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
Z\left(\emptyset\right)=\mathbb{C}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

This is a non-triviality condition.
 Therefore, for each (
\begin_inset Formula $d+1$
\end_inset

)-dimensional manifold 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 without boundary, 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial M=\emptyset$

\begin_inset Formula $Z$
\end_inset

 assigns a number: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
Z\left(M\right)\in\mathbb{C}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 This number associated to a closed (
\begin_inset Formula $d+1$
\end_inset

)-dimensional manifold is called the partition function.
 Not only is it an important quantity physically, but it also has mathematical
 applications, such as giving a topological invariant of the closed manifold
 
\begin_inset Formula $M$

\end_inset

 is trivial: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
Z\left(N\times I\right)=\mathrm{id}_{\mathcal{H}_{N}}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 Since in a topological theory manifolds diffeomorphic to each other should
 be considered as the identical, each cobordism class defines a linear map.
 This means that the addition of a cylinder is a trivial operation, the
 associated linear map is the identity.
 This condition is another major difference from ordinary QFTs.
 For example, for (
\begin_inset Formula $2+1$

 is identically 
\begin_inset Formula $0$

 One can actually take an equivalent definition of TQFT in slightly different

Lattice model as discrete QFT

\begin_layout Standard
Now let us move on to the discussion on lattice model.
 First of all, let us begin with the question of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

what is lattice model?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Probably there is no unique definition of lattice model.
 We here would like to characterize lattice model by a discrete version
 of QFT.
 What we have learnt in the previous subsection is that a (
\begin_inset Formula $d+1$
\end_inset

)-dimensional QFT may be defined by an appropriate functor 
\begin_inset Formula $Z_{\mathrm{Q}}^{d+1}$
\end_inset

, which produces a number for each (
\begin_inset Formula $d+1$
\end_inset

)-dimensional closed manifold 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
Z_{\mathrm{Q}}^{d+1}\left(M\right)\in\mathbb{C},
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 which is called the partition function of the model, and 
\begin_inset Formula $Z_{\mathrm{Q}}^{d+1}$
\end_inset

 satisfies additional some reasonable conditions for each QFT of interest.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We introduce lattice model in the same way.
 For a (
\begin_inset Formula $d+1$
\end_inset

)-dimensional closed lattice 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

, a (
\begin_inset Formula $d+1$
\end_inset

)-dimensional lattice model is defined by 
\begin_inset Formula $Z_{\mathrm{L}}^{d+1}$
\end_inset

, which produces a number 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
Z_{\mathrm{L}}^{d+1}\left(L\right)\in\mathbb{C},
\end{equation}

\end_inset

which is again called the partition function, and 
\begin_inset Formula $Z_{\mathrm{L}}^{d+1}$
\end_inset

 satisfies additional some reasonable conditions.
 The most typical example of lattice model in particle physics is lattice
 gauge theory or lattice QCD.

 a computer, one needs to discretize the theory and put it on a lattice.
 In this sense, numerical analysis of field theory is always regarded as
 a lattice model.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

 For such theories, it is really clear that the model is defined by a discrete
 version of QFTs; One compactifies the spacetime manifold 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{4}$
\end_inset

 to four-torus 
\begin_inset Formula $T^{4}$
\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
Throughout the paper, we will consider only 
\begin_inset Formula $d=0$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 case of lattice model, and we call each case as 1d or 2d lattice model.
 To prepare for the discussion of integrability, we take the prominent example
 of statistical lattice model called the Ising model.
 We first briefly review the generality of the Ising model and compare with
 field theory, and then introduce the transfer matrix which is essentially
 a time evolution operator in a discrete quantum system.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Prominent example – the Ising model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Ising model is a very good introduction to integrable lattice model.
 The 1d and 2d Ising model is known to be exactly solvable, whose meaning
 we will clarify in a moment, and it is called integrable.
 To see the generality of the Ising model, we first define 2d lattice and
 spin configurations on it.

\end_inset

 A spin configuration on the lattice 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 is defined by a map
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{s}:L\longrightarrow\left\{ +1,-1\right\} ,
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where usually 
\begin_inset Formula $+1$
\end_inset

 is called up spin and 
\begin_inset Formula $-1$
\end_inset

 is down spin.
 The map defines up or down spin at each site of the lattice 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

.
 So it can also be thought of as an assignment of 
\begin_inset Formula $+1$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $-1$
\end_inset

 on all the sites of the lattice 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

.
 We often denote the spin at each site by its image 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{I}:=\mathbf{s}\left(I\right),\,I\in L$
\end_inset

.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $S\left(L\right)$
\end_inset

 be the set of all the spin configurations.
 Since spin configurations are defined on the 
\begin_inset Formula $M\times N$
\end_inset

 periodic lattice, the number of elements in 
\begin_inset Formula $S\left(L\right)$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{MN}$
\end_inset

 In other words, the number of all the allowed configurations of spins on
 the lattice 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{MN}$

 This is one of the simplest spin systems, in which only the nearest neighbor
 spins have interactions.
 From this energy functional, the partition function of the Ising model

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta\in\mathbb{R}_{\geq0}$
\end_inset

 is an inverse temperature.
 The summand is generically called the Boltzmann weight as well as in field
 theory.
 In this expression, one recognizes that the right-hand side is a discrete
 version of path integral expression in field theory.
 The energy functional is corresponding to the action functional of a field
 theory, 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta^{-1}$
\end_inset

 is the Planck's constant, and the sum over all the spin configurations
 is the path integral over all the field configurations.
 Given a periodic lattice

 the partition function of QFT which returns a number as well if a closed

\frac{1}{MN}\left\langle E\right\rangle _{p}=\frac{1}{MN}\frac{1}{Z}\sum_{\mathbf{s}\in S\left(L\right)}E\left(\mathbf{s}\right)e^{-\beta E\left(\mathbf{s}\right)},
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 which is obtained from the derivative of the free energy, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{MN}\left\langle E\right\rangle _{p}=\frac{\partial}{\partial\beta}\left(\beta f\left(\beta\right)\right).
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Generally speaking, the free energy provides us all the information of the
 system.
 For example, the state most likely to happen is given by the critical point
 of the free energy, and we can in principle compute physical quantities
 such as expectation value of energy, fluctuation, specific heat, and so
 on.
 To make a lattice model as a physically meaningful system, however, one
 needs to take the thermodynamic limit; 
\begin_inset Formula $M,N\rightarrow\infty$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore, in this sense, integrability of lattice model is characterized
 by the calculability of an exact free energy at the thermodynamic limit.
 This may be rephrased by the calculability of the partition function as
 well.
 Based on these argument, we shall see the integrability of the Ising model
 in the next subsection.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Transfer matrix and integrability
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is well known that 1d and 2d Ising model is exactly solvable in the sense
 that one can exactly compute its free energy in the thermodynamic limit.
 Both 1d and 2d cases are solved by so-called the method of transfer matrix.
 To see this, for simplicity in this section we consider 1d Ising model.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The setup is almost the same as in the 2d case.
 A 1d lattice on torus and a spin configuration is defined by
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
L_{1d}=\mathbb{Z}_{N}=\left\{ 1,\ldots,N\right\} ,
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{s}:L_{1d}\longrightarrow\left\{ \pm1\right\} .
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Define the energy functional of 1d Ising model by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
E_{1d\,\mathrm{Ising}}\left(\mathbf{s}\right)=-J\sum_{i=1}^{N}s_{i}s_{i+1},\quad\,s_{N+1}=s_{1}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 Then the partition function of 1d Ising model is defined by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
Z\left(L_{1d},E_{\mathrm{1d}};\beta\right) & :=\sum_{\mathbf{s}}e^{-\beta E_{1d}\left(\mathbf{s}\right)}\nonumber \\
 & =\sum_{s_{1},\ldots,s_{N}=\pm1}e^{Ks_{1}s_{N}}\cdots e^{Ks_{3}s_{2}}e^{Ks_{2}s_{1}},
\end{align}

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $K:=\beta J$
\end_inset

.
 Let us now introduce the 
\emph on
transfer matrix
\emph default
, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
T:=\left(e^{Kss'}\right)_{s,s'=\pm1}=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
e^{K} & e^{-K}\\
e^{-K} & e^{K}
\end{array}\right),
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 where the indices of row and column are specified by 
\begin_inset Formula $+1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $-1$
\end_inset

, respectively.
 Using this matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

, the partition function is rewritten as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
Z\left(\beta\right)=\sum_{s_{1},\ldots,s_{N}=\pm1}T_{s_{1}s_{N}}\cdots T_{s_{3}s_{2}}T_{s_{2}s_{1}}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 By definition of matrix multiplication, the partition function is eventually
 given by a trace: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
Z\left(\beta\right) & =\sum_{s_{1}=\pm1}\left(T^{N}\right)_{s_{1}s_{1}}\nonumber \\
 & =\mathrm{Tr}_{\mathbb{C}^{2}}\left(T^{N}\right).
\end{align}

\end_inset

 This expression tells us that we have the quantum Hilbert space 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{C}^{2}$
\end_inset

 at the boundary of each 1d segment, and the transfer matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 sends a state to the adjacent site, which is the discrete 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

time evolution
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of this system; 
\begin_inset Formula $\log T\propto$
\end_inset

 Hamiltonian as we saw in 1d QFT in section (what is QFT?).
 This corresponds to the analogue of Hamiltonian or operator formalism in
 field theory.
 In operator formalism, spins are replaced by the Pauli matrices, and original
 classical up spin and down spin are replaced by the eigenvalues and eigenvector
s of the Pauli matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma^{z}$
\end_inset

.
 Further, the non-commutativity is now manifest in a way that the spins
 and their time evolution is given by matrices, this is the consequence
 of quantization.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the expression above of the partition function, let us consider the thermodyn
amic limit 
\begin_inset Formula $N\rightarrow\infty$
\end_inset

.
 The eigenvalues of 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 are easily obtained and let them be 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{0}>\lambda_{1}$
\end_inset

, then we have the free energy
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
-\beta f\left(\beta\right) & =\lim_{N\rightarrow\infty}\frac{1}{N}\log Z\left(\beta\right)\nonumber \\
 & =\lim_{N\rightarrow\infty}\frac{1}{N}\log\lambda_{0}\left(1+\left(\frac{\lambda_{1}}{\lambda_{0}}\right)^{N}\right)\nonumber \\
 & =\log\lambda_{0}.
\end{align}

\end_inset

 We conclude that the free energy in the thermodynamic limit is just given
 by the largest eigenvalue of the transfer matrix.
 Again, integrability of lattice model is rephrased as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
 & \textrm{One can exatly find the eigenvalues of transfer matrix}\\
 & \Rightarrow\,\textrm{Can exactly compute the free enrgy}\\
 & \Rightarrow\,\textrm{The system is integrable. }
\end{align*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The transfer matrices of 1d and 2d Ising model are diagonalizable and one
 can exactly find their eigenvectors and eigenvalues using, for example,
 algebraic Bethe ansatz.
 In this sense, 1d and 2d Ising model are said to be integrable, or exactly
 solvable.
 Then, a natural question arises; when can we diagonalize the transfer matrix
 of a lattice model? This actually leads to the most fundamental answer
 to the question of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

what is integrable model.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 A canonical answer is 
\emph on
Yang-Baxter equation
\emph default
.
 When the Boltzmann weight with spectral parameters, which take values in
 a Riemann surface, satisfies the Yang-Baxter equation, the lattice model
 is integrable.
 We will give an explanation of this definition of integrability in next
 subsection in some detail, with its origin from TQFT with extra dimensions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Integrability from TQFT in extra dimensions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section we provide a general discussion to relate four-dimensional
 supersymmetric gauge theories and integrable lattice models.
 We clarify that such a correspondence between gauge theories and lattice
 models emerges from a TQFT in extra dimensions.
 We first give a step-by-step explanation from two-dimensional TQFT to integrabl
e lattice model, and then put the argument in the setup of brane tilings.
 Branes in string theory are powerful enough to yield the systematic method
 to relate a class of supersymmetric gauge theories with integrable lattice
 models, as we will see.
 To begin with, we present a general prescription of brane constructions
 at a formal level.
 Concrete setups and more details will be given in later sections.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Lattice models from TQFTs with line operators
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose that we have a two-dimensional TQFT 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathsf{T}$
\end_inset

 on a two-torus 
\begin_inset Formula $T^{2}$
\end_inset

 equipped with line operators 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{i}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $i=1,\ldots,l$
\end_inset

.
 Wrap them around one-cycles 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{i}$
\end_inset

 on the torus in such a way that they form an 
\begin_inset Formula $m\times n$
\end_inset

 lattice.
 We wish to consider the correlation function of this configuration of line
 operators.
 To compute it, our strategy is to break up the torus into pieces and perform
 in turn the path integral piecewise.
 Then the original correlation function is reconstructed by combining these
 pieces.
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In the following, we will compute the correlation function by embedding
 the closed TQFT with line operators into an open/closed TQFT with line
 operators, or defect TQFT.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us consider the following piece of surface which contains an intersection
 of two line operators 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{j}$
\end_inset

: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
i\,j.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 If one thinks of the above picture as the world-sheet of two scattering
 open strings, one can regard the above picture as follows: The endpoints
 of the open strings sweep out the double-lined arcs, on which D-branes
 are there and the boundary conditions (Chern-Paton factors) are specified
 by labels 
\begin_inset Formula $a,\,b,\,c,\,d$
\end_inset

.
 The line operators are the world-lines of particles associated with the
 open strings.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The path integral for the above surface produces a linear map
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
R_{ij}\left(\begin{array}{cc}
a & d\\
b & c
\end{array}\right):V_{ab,i}\otimes V_{bc,j}\longrightarrow V_{ad,j}\otimes V_{dc,i},
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{ab,i}$
\end_inset

 is the space of states of the open string propagating along 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{i}$
\end_inset

 with the boundary conditions on the left and the right ends specified by
 
\begin_inset Formula $a,\,b$
\end_inset

, respectively.
 We call this map the R-matrix (or R-operator) associated with this decorated
 surface.
 To reconstruct the original configuration of line operators, we glue pieces
 together.
 Gluing them amounts to the composition of R-matrices.
 For example, gluing two pieces horizontally gives 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
=R_{ik}\left(\begin{array}{cc}
d & e\\
c & f
\end{array}\right)\circ_{V_{dc,i}}R_{ij}\left(\begin{array}{cc}
a & d\\
b & c
\end{array}\right).
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The original configuration is thus obtained by gluing all the pieces.
 It, however, still has holes assigned boundary conditions as in figures,
 which we must fill by summing over the boundary conditions.
 To do this, let us recall that the path integral on a finite-length cylinder
 with boundary condition 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 imposed on one end defines a closed string state 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|a\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 as known as a boundary state.
 Similarly, the path integral on a disk with no insertion of operators defines
 a state 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|1\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 on the boundary, see figures.
 Assume that we have chosen the set of boundary conditions 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 to be sufficiently large so that the state 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|1\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 can be written as a superposition of boundary states:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left|1\right\rangle =\sum_{a\in B}c_{a}\left|a\right\rangle .
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 Then, the sum over the boundary conditions gives the state 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|1\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 on the boundary of each hole, which is replaced with a disk: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\sum_{a\in B}c_{a}\left(a\right)=\sum_{a\in B}c_{a}\left(\left|a\right\rangle \right)=\left|1\right\rangle .
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 Thus the holes are filled and the original configuration on the torus is
 reconstructed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now that we have understood how to reconstruct the correlation function
 of line operators in the field theoretic point of view, let us reinterpret
 this procedure as an operation in statistical lattice model.
 Rephrasing the procedures so far, it is clear that the above configuration
 defines a partition function of a statistical spin model.
 The model has spins located at two kinds of sites, 
\begin_inset Formula $\ocircle$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\circledcirc$
\end_inset

.
 They correspond to the open string states and the boundary states.
 A spin at 
\begin_inset Formula $\ocircle$
\end_inset

 takes values in the chosen basis for the relevant open string states 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{ab,i}$
\end_inset

, while that at 
\begin_inset Formula $\circledcirc$
\end_inset

 is valued in 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

.
 The Boltzmann weights for each spin configuration are given by the matrix
 elements of R-matrix and the coefficients of boundary states 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{a}$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, we conclude that the correlation function of line operators 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathcal{L}_{i}\right\} $
\end_inset

 on the torus coincides with the partition function of a statistical spin
 model defined on the periodic lattice formed by the line operators:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left\langle \prod_{i=1}^{l}\mathcal{L}_{i}\left(C_{i}\right)\right\rangle _{\mathsf{T},T^{2}}=Z_{\mathsf{L}\left(\mathsf{T}\right),\left\{ \mathcal{L}_{i}\left(C_{i}\right)\right\} }.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathsf{L}\left(\mathsf{T}\right)$
\end_inset

 denotes the lattice model arising from the TQFT 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathsf{T}$
\end_inset

 with the line operators and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathcal{L}_{i}\left(C_{i}\right)\right\} $
\end_inset

 is the lattice formed by line operators 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{i}$
\end_inset

 wrapping around 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 By this construction, we can view typical examples of lattice models.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
IRF model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If 
\begin_inset Formula $\dim V_{ab,i}=1$
\end_inset

 for any 
\begin_inset Formula $a,\,b,\,i$
\end_inset

, in this case we can ignore the spins at 
\begin_inset Formula $\ocircle$
\end_inset

.
 We just sum over the boundary conditions and such a spin system 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathsf{L}\left(\mathsf{T}\right)$
\end_inset

 is called 
\emph on
interaction-round-a-face model
\emph default
, or 
\emph on
IRF model
\emph default
 for short.
 The spins are placed on the faces of the lattice, and interaction takes
 place among four spins surrounding a vertex.
 The 2d Ising model actually can be formulated as an IRF model by taking
 vertex-face transformation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Vertex model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 consists of a single boundary condition, say 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

, we can simply write the open string state space by 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{i}:=V_{aa,i}$
\end_inset

, and the R-matrix is represented only by a crossing of two lines: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
R_{ij}=,
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
R_{ij}:V_{i}\otimes V_{j}\longrightarrow V_{j}\otimes V_{i}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The space of states 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{i}$
\end_inset

 can also be thought of as the Hilbert space of a particle propagating on
 the line operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 In this case we can ignore the spins at 
\begin_inset Formula $\circledcirc$
\end_inset

 since there is no summation over boundary conditions.
 This means that the lattice model 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathsf{L}\left(\mathsf{T}\right)$
\end_inset

 is called a 
\emph on
vertex model
\emph default
: Spins are living on the edges of the lattice and interact with each other
 at the vertices.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can always recast our lattice model into a vertex model by setting 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{i}:=\bigoplus_{a,b\in B}V_{ab,i}$
\end_inset

, at least formally, and declaring that all newly introduced R-matrix elements,
 which correspond to scattering processes with inconsistent Chan-Paton factors,
 vanish.
 We can also absorb the coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{a}$
\end_inset

 into the R-matrix elements by appropriate rescaling.
 In what follows we implicitly perform this reformulation, and restrict
 ourselves to vertex model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A remarkable aspect of this construction of lattice models is that it allows
 us to understand integrability from a higher-dimensional point of view.
 This is crucial observation by Costelllo [Costello].
 In our lattice model, consider a horizontal line operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{i}$
\end_inset

 intersecting vertical line operators 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{j}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $j=1,\ldots,n$
\end_inset

.
 Concatenating the R-matrices in this row, we get the row-to-row transfer
 matrix: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
T_{i}==\mathrm{Tr}_{V_{i}}\left(R_{i,n}\circ_{V_{i}}\cdots\circ_{V_{i}}R_{i,1}\right).
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 The hooks on the horizontal line are to remind us that the periodic boundary
 condition is imposed.
 This gives an endomorphism of 
\begin_inset Formula $\bigotimes_{j=1}^{n}V_{j}$
\end_inset

 which maps a state just below 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{j}$
\end_inset

 to another state above it, namely the transfer matrix defines the time
 evolution of this spin system and 
\begin_inset Formula $\bigotimes_{j=1}^{n}V_{j}$
\end_inset

 is the quantum Hilbert space.
 In terms of transfer matrices, the partition function is written as a trace,
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
Z_{\mathsf{L}\left(\mathsf{T}\right),\left\{ \mathcal{L}_{i}\left(C_{i}\right)\right\} }=\mathrm{Tr}\left(T_{n+m}\cdots T_{n+1}\right),
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 where the trace is taken over the total Hilbert space 
\begin_inset Formula $\bigotimes_{j=1}^{n}V_{j}$
\end_inset

.
 An important point is that the underlying field theory is a TQFT, and hence
 a state evolves trivially on a cylinder unless it hits something, line
 operators in the present case.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now suppose that each line operator depends on a continuous parameter which
 is an element of some smooth manifold 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

.
 This parameter is called 
\emph on
spectral parameter
\emph default
 of the lattice model.
 We denote the spectral parameter of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{i}$
\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{i}$
\end_inset

, then the R-matrix and the transfer matrix are rewritten by
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
R_{ij} & \longrightarrow R_{ij}\left(u_{i},u_{j}\right),\\
T_{i} & \longrightarrow T_{i}\left(u_{i};u_{1},\ldots,u_{n}\right).
\end{align}

\end_inset

 To avoid clutter, we fix 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{1},\ldots,u_{n}$
\end_inset

 and suppress them below.
 A vertex model is said to be integrable if the transfer matrices 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{i}\left(u_{i}\right)$
\end_inset

 are meromorphic functions of 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{i}$
\end_inset

 and commute with each other:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left[T_{i}\left(u_{i}\right),T_{j}\left(u_{j}\right)\right]=0,\quad u_{i}\neq u_{j}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 When the transfer matrices with different spectral parameters commute,
 we can find a series of mutually commuting operators on the total Hilbert
 space 
\begin_inset Formula $\bigotimes_{j=1}^{n}V_{j}$
\end_inset

 by Laurent expansion of the transfer matrix.
 In particular, they commute with the transfer matrix, which means they
 produce an infinite number of conserved quantities.
 In fact, the commutativity of transfer matrix implies that one can find
 the exact eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the transfer matrix, as we saw
 in the Ising model in the previous section.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The situation considered here, namely the addition of spectral parameters
 and commuting transfer matrix, is naturally realized if the TQFT has 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

extra dimensions.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 In this scenario, we really start with a higher-dimensional theory 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\mathsf{T}}$
\end_inset

 formulated on the product space 
\begin_inset Formula $S\times T^{2}$
\end_inset

, which is topological on the torus 
\begin_inset Formula $T^{2}$
\end_inset

 but not on 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

.
 We wrap line operators 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{i}$
\end_inset

 around 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ u_{i}\right\} \times C_{i}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{i}$
\end_inset

 are points on 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

.
 If one can see only the torus 
\begin_inset Formula $T^{2}$
\end_inset

 and is unaware of the extra dimensions 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

, the theory seems to be the previous two-dimensional TQFT 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathsf{T}\cong\tilde{\mathsf{T}}\left[S\right]$
\end_inset

 that has parameters taking values in 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

.
 One finds that line operators 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{i}\left[u_{i}\right]$
\end_inset

 wrapping around 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{i}$
\end_inset

 carry continuous parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{i}$
\end_inset

 in the seemingly two-dimensional theory, and the correlation function for
 this configuration of line operators is given by the partition function
 of a lattice model 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathsf{L}\left(\tilde{\mathsf{T}}\left[S\right]\right)$
\end_inset

 defined on the lattice 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathcal{L}_{i}\left[u_{i}\right]\left(C_{i}\right)\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For a generic choice of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ u_{i}\right\} $
\end_inset

, the transfer matrices of the lattice model 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathsf{L}\left(\tilde{\mathsf{T}}\left[S\right]\right)$
\end_inset

 commute since the two horizontal line operators in the above equation can
 move freely and interchange their positions owing to the topological nature
 along 
\begin_inset Formula $T^{2}$
\end_inset

; no phase transition occurs when they pass each other as they do not meet
 in the full spacetime 
\begin_inset Formula $S\times T^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, integrability follows from the existence of extra dimensions, whose
 coordinates provide continuous spectral parameters.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In fact, we can deduce integrability from another point of view.
 By the same logic, we have the unitarity relation 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
R_{ji}\left(u_{j},u_{i}\right)R_{ij}\left(u_{i},u_{j}\right)=\mathrm{id}_{V_{i}\otimes V_{j}},
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 and the Yang-Baxter equation
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
R_{ij}\left(u_{i},u_{j}\right)R_{ik}\left(u_{i},u_{k}\right)R_{jk}\left(u_{j},u_{k}\right)=R_{jk}\left(u_{j},u_{k}\right)R_{ik}\left(u_{i},u_{k}\right)R_{ij}\left(u_{i},u_{j}\right),
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 where the R-matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{ij}$
\end_inset

 acts on 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{i}\otimes V_{j}$
\end_inset

 as an intertwiner and trivial on 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{k}$
\end_inset

, etc.
 From these two relations we can reproduce the commutativity of the transfer
 matrix.
 We should emphasize that the Yang-Baxter equation is a local condition.
 When the Boltzmann weight locally satisfies the Yang-Baxter equation, it
 extends to the commutativity of the transfer matrix and hence the integrability
 of the model.
 In this sense, the Yang-Baxter equation is the fundamental condition of
 integrability of a lattice model.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before going into the discussion of brane construction, we would like to
 generalize the above arguments further higher-dimensional situations.
 First of all, replace the two-torus 
\begin_inset Formula $T^{2}$
\end_inset

 with a general two-dimensional surface 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma$
\end_inset

, along which line operators are wrapped.
 We now have 
\begin_inset Formula $S\times\Sigma$
\end_inset

, and similarly to the above a lattice model is defined on 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma$
\end_inset

 by line operators with spectral parameters.
 Let us consider the case that we really have more extra dimensions and
 a higher-dimensional theory is formulated on 
\begin_inset Formula $S\times M\times\Sigma$
\end_inset

 , where 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 is some smooth manifold.
 The line operators we had may descend from extended operators of dimension
 greater than one.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathsf{T}$
\end_inset

 again be the new higher-dimensional theory, and suppose that it is topological
 on 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma$
\end_inset

 and has extended operators 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{E}_{i}$
\end_inset

 whose codimension is greater than 
\begin_inset Formula $\dim S$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{E}_{i}$
\end_inset

 on submanifolds of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ u_{i}\right\} \times N_{i}\times C_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathsf{T}\left[S\times M\right]$
\end_inset

 is again regarded as a two-dimensional TQFT defined on 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma$
\end_inset

, the correlation function of the operators 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{E}_{i}$
\end_inset

 still should coincides with the partition function of an integrable lattice
 model 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathsf{L}\left(\mathsf{T}\left[S\times M\right]\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The model is defined on the lattice formed by the line operators 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{E}_{i}\left[\left\{ u_{i}\right\} \times N_{i}\right]$
\end_inset

, which are the image of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{E}_{i}$
\end_inset

 in the two-dimensional theory 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathsf{T}\left[S\times M\right]$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As well as we can view the higher-dimensional theory as a two-dimensional
 TQFT, we may also view it as a theory 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathsf{T}\left[\Sigma\right]$
\end_inset

, which is a QFT on 
\begin_inset Formula $S\times M$
\end_inset

 specified by the surface 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma$
\end_inset

.
 In this theory, the operators 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{E}_{i}$
\end_inset

 are seen as extended operators 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{E}_{i}\left[C_{i}\right]$
\end_inset

 supported on 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ u_{i}\right\} \times N_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 Then, we have another relation
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left\langle \prod_{i=1}^{l}\mathcal{E}_{i}\left[C_{i}\right]\left(\left\{ u_{i}\right\} \times N_{i}\right)\right\rangle _{\mathsf{T}\left[\Sigma\right],S\times M}=Z_{\mathsf{L}\left(\mathsf{T}\left[S\times M\right]\right),\left\{ \mathcal{E}_{i}\left[\left\{ u_{i}\right\} \times N_{i}\right]\left(C_{i}\right)\right\} }.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 Thus, we finally arrive at a correspondence between a QFT on 
\begin_inset Formula $S\times M$
\end_inset

 equipped with extended operators and an integrable lattice model on 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma$
\end_inset

.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Brane construction and correspondence
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have seen above that a lattice model is realized by a lattice of line
 operators in a two-dimensional TQFT, and it is integrable if the TQFT is
 embedded in higher dimensions and the line operators come from extended
 operators localized in some directions of the extra dimensions.
 Now we explain how to get such structures of correspondence of (previous
 equation) using branes in string theory.
 The brane construction here is still rather abstract.
 A little bit more concrete setups will be given in next section.
 The readers may skip this subsection for the first reading and jump to
 the next section.

Consider a type II string theory in a ten-dimensional spacetime 
\begin_inset Formula

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma$
\end_inset

 is a two-dimensional surface embedded in

 Introduce a stack of

 ending on the NS5-branes, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{p-1}$
\end_inset

 is a subspace of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{4}$
\end_inset

 (assuming 
\begin_inset Formula $p\leq5$
\end_inset

) and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma_{i}$
\end_inset

 are surfaces in 
\begin_inset Formula $T^{*}\Sigma$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma_{i}\cap\Sigma=C_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 See figures.
 Provided that 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma_{i}$
\end_inset

 are suitably chosen, this brane system preserves four supercharges.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The low-energy dynamics of the NS5-branes is governed by a six-dimensional
 theory 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathsf{T}_{\mathrm{NS5}}$
\end_inset

 on 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{4}\times\Sigma$
\end_inset

.
 The theory 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathsf{T}_{\mathrm{NS5}}$
\end_inset

 is depending on whether IIA or IIB theory we are considering: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\textrm{IIA : } & \textrm{\ensuremath{\mathcal{N}=\left(2,0\right)} superconformal QFT of type \ensuremath{A_{N-1}}},\\
\textrm{IIB : } & \textrm{\ensuremath{\mathcal{N}=\left(1,1\right)} super Yang-Mills theory with gauge group SU\ensuremath{\left(N\right)}}.
\end{align*}

\end_inset

 The theory 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathsf{T}_{\mathrm{NS5}}$
\end_inset

 is formulated on 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{4}\times\Sigma$
\end_inset

, with topological twist along 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma$
\end_inset

 which breaks half of sixteen supercharges.
 In this twisted theory, D
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}$
\end_inset

 create 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

-dimensional defects 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{E}_{\mathrm{D}p_{i}}$
\end_inset

 on 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{p-1}\times C_{i}$
\end_inset

, reducing the number of unbroken supercharges to four.
 From the point of view of a four-dimensional observer, this brane configuration
 gives half-BPS defects 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{E}_{\mathrm{D}p_{i}}\left[C_{i}\right]$
\end_inset

 in an 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{N}=2$
\end_inset

 theory 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathsf{T}_{\mathrm{NS5}}\left[\Sigma\right]$
\end_inset

.
 The total system is invariant under a U(
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

) R-symmetry originating from the rotational symmetry on the 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{2}$
\end_inset

 factor of the ten-dimensional spacetime.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us take a three-manifold 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 and (
\begin_inset Formula $p-2$
\end_inset

)-submanifolds 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{i}$
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

, and modify the above construction so that the world-volumes of the NS5-branes
 and the D
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

-branes become 
\begin_inset Formula $S^{1}\times M\times\Sigma$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $S^{1}\times N_{i}\times\Sigma_{i}$
\end_inset

, respectively.
 At low energies, we get the same theory 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathsf{T}_{\mathrm{NS5}}$
\end_inset

 formulated on 
\begin_inset Formula $S^{1}\times M\times\Sigma$
\end_inset

 and defects 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{E}_{\mathrm{D}p_{i}}$
\end_inset

 located on 
\begin_inset Formula $S^{1}\times N_{i}\times C_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 In general, this modification completely breaks supersymmetry.
 For certain choices of 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{i}$
\end_inset

, however, there is a string background in which a fraction of supersymmetry
 is still preserved.
 In such a background, the path integral computes the 
\emph on
supersymmetric index
\emph default
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathsf{T}_{\mathrm{NS5}}$
\end_inset

, defined with respect to the Hilbert space on 
\begin_inset Formula $M\times\Sigma$
\end_inset

 in the presence of defects 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{E}_{\mathrm{D}p_{i}}$
\end_inset

 inserted on 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{i}\times C_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A salient feature of supersymmetric indices is that they are protected against
 continuous changes of various parameters of the theory.
 This means that the index of our theory is invariant under deformations
 of the geometric data of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{i}$
\end_inset

, namely the metric on 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma$
\end_inset

 and the shapes of 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 In other words, the theory 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathsf{T}_{\mathrm{NS5}}$
\end_inset

 on 
\begin_inset Formula $S^{1}\times M\times\Sigma$
\end_inset

 is topological on 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma$
\end_inset

, as far as the computation of the index is concerned.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To relate the present setup to the one considered in the previous subsection,
 we apply T-duality along 
\begin_inset Formula $S^{1}$
\end_inset

.
 It turns D
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}$
\end_inset

 into D
\begin_inset Formula $\left(p-1\right)$
\end_inset

-branes D
\begin_inset Formula $\left(p-1\right)_{i}$
\end_inset

, localized at points 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{i}$
\end_inset

 along the dual circle 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{S}^{1}$
\end_inset

, while sending the NS5-branes to those in the other type II string theory.
 The new NS5-branes produce the dual six-dimensional theory 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\mathsf{T}}_{\mathrm{NS5}}$
\end_inset

 on 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{S}^{1}\times M\times\Sigma$
\end_inset

, and in this theory D
\begin_inset Formula $\left(p-1\right)_{i}$
\end_inset

 create (
\begin_inset Formula $p-1$
\end_inset

)-dimensional defects 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{E}_{\mathrm{D}\left(p-1\right)_{i}}$
\end_inset

 on 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ u_{i}\right\} \times N_{i}\times C_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 Thus we are in the situation studied in the last subsection, and the correlatio
n function for this configuration coincides with the partition function
 of an integrable lattice model: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left\langle \prod_{i=1}^{l}\mathcal{E}_{\mathrm{D}p_{i}}\left[C_{i}\right]\left(S^{1}\times N_{i}\right)\right\rangle _{\mathsf{T}_{\mathrm{NS5}}\left[\Sigma\right],S^{1}\times M}=Z_{\mathsf{L}\left(\tilde{\mathsf{T}}_{\mathrm{NS5}}\left[\tilde{S}^{1}\times M\right]\right),\left\{ \mathcal{E}_{\mathrm{D}\left(p-1\right)_{i}}\left[\left\{ u_{i}\right\} \times N_{i}\right]\left(C_{i}\right)\right\} }.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 Here the left-hand side is expressed in the original frame; it implicitly
 depends on each spectral parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{i}$
\end_inset

 through the holonomy 
\begin_inset Formula $\exp\left(2\pi\mathrm{i}u_{i}\right)$
\end_inset

 around 
\begin_inset Formula $S^{1}$
\end_inset

 of the gauge field for the flavor symmetry U
\begin_inset Formula $(1)_{i}$
\end_inset

 supported on D
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 The holonomy appears in the index as a refinement parameter, or 
\emph on
fugacity
\emph default
, associated with U
\begin_inset Formula $(1)_{i}$
\end_inset

.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Defects as transfer matrices
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, we apply the construction developed in the precious subsections
 to the main theme of this paper; integrable lattice models and defects
 as transfer matrices.
 Let us consider 
\begin_inset Formula $p=5$
\end_inset

 case of the brane construction in the last subsection.
 To conform with the standard convention, take S-duality first and we still
 have D5- and NS5-branes 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
N\,\mathrm{D5} & \quad S^{1}\times M\times\Sigma,\\
\mathrm{NS5}_{i} & \quad S^{1}\times N_{i}\times\Sigma_{i},
\end{align*}

\end_inset

 where NS
\begin_inset Formula $5_{i}$
\end_inset

 create defects 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{E}_{\mathrm{NS}5_{i}}$
\end_inset

 on 
\begin_inset Formula $S^{1}\times N_{i}\times C_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One should notice that in this setup we necessarily have 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{i}=M$
\end_inset

 and thus the defects 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{E}_{\mathrm{NS}5_{i}}$
\end_inset

 fill the whole 
\begin_inset Formula $S^{1}\times M$
\end_inset

, which produces a four-dimensional theory 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathsf{T}_{\mathrm{D5NS5}}\left[\Sigma\right]
\]

\end_inset

with 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{N}=1$
\end_inset

 supersymmetry.
 Then we now have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left\langle 1\right\rangle _{\mathsf{T}_{\mathrm{D5NS5}}\left[\Sigma\right],S^{1}\times M}=Z_{\mathsf{L}\left(\mathsf{T}_{\mathrm{D5NS5}}\left[S^{1}\times M\right]\right),\left\{ \mathcal{E}_{i}\left[S^{1}\times M\right]\left(C_{i}\right)\right\} }.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

For example, when 
\begin_inset Formula $M=S^{3}$
\end_inset

, the left-hand side is given by the supersymmetric index for 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{N}=1$
\end_inset

 theory and the right-hand side corresponds to the partition function of
 Bazhanov-Sergeev integrable lattice model [Bazhanov-Sergeev, Spiridonov,
 Yamazaki].
 When 
\begin_inset Formula $M=L\left(p,1\right)$
\end_inset

, lens space, the left-hand side is computed in [Yamazaki], which defines
 a new integrable lattice model through this correspondence.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The brane tiling construction of integrable lattice models can be enriched
 by introduction of additional defects.
 Besides the previously defined D5NS5-brane system, introduce a D3-brane
 such as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\mathrm{D3} & \quad S^{1}\times N\times C\times\mathbb{R}_{+},\\
\mathrm{D3'} & \quad S^{1}\times\left\{ 0\right\} \times C'\times\mathbb{R}^{2},
\end{align}

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 is a curve in 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $C,\,C'$
\end_inset

 are 1-cycles on 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma$
\end_inset

.
 A single D3-brane insertion corresponds to a new oriented line in the integrabl
e lattice model, which we represent by a dashed line.
 Now that we have two kinds of lines, we can define three R-matrices: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
R=,\quad\,L=,\quad\,\mathcal{R}=.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 The middle one is usually called 
\emph on
L-operator
\emph default
.
 Correspondingly, we have four Yang-Baxter equations, involving zero to
 three dashed lines.
 Those that involving one or two dashed line, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
RLL
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 are called 
\emph on
RLL relations
\emph default
.
 The effect of the insertion of such an additional defect on the lattice
 model is seen in terms of the L-operator.
 The neighborhood of the dashed line looks like 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
transferfromL
\end{equation}

\end_inset

This diagram shows that the defect acts on the lattice model by a transfer
 matrix constructed from L-operators.
 Thus, the insertion of a defect operator in four-dimensional theory is
 mapped into lattice model side as the action of a transfer matrix constructed
 from L-operators.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What we would like to discuss in detail in the subsequent sections are the
 introduction of a single D3-brane (equation of D3D3') to the D5NS5-brane
 system, and clarify that the correspondence with the additional defects.
 In the next two sections, we are considering the followings: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
For the case of single D3, let 
\begin_inset Formula $M=S^{3}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma=T^{2}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $N=S^{1}$
\end_inset

.
 Then the D3 creates a surface defect on 
\begin_inset Formula $S^{1}\times S^{1}$
\end_inset

 and it acts on supersymmetric index as a transfer matrix in the corresponding
 lattice model: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\left\langle 1\right\rangle _{\mathsf{T}_{\mathrm{D5NS5}}\left[\Sigma\right],S^{1}\times S^{3}} & =\mathcal{I}_{S^{1}\times S^{3}}\left(p,q,t\right),\\
Z_{\mathsf{L}\left(\mathsf{T}_{\mathrm{D5NS5}}\left[S^{1}\times S^{3}\right]\right),\left\{ \mathcal{E}_{i}\left[S^{1}\times S^{3}\right]\left(C_{i}\right)\right\} } & =Z_{\mathrm{Bazhanov-Sergeev}},
\end{align}

\end_inset

 the surface defect index is represented as a difference operator acting
 on the original supersymmetric index [Gaiotto-Rastelli-Razamat, Gadde-Gukov],
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left\langle S_{\left(r,s\right)}\right\rangle _{\mathsf{T}_{\mathrm{D5NS5}}\left[\Sigma\right]}=\mathfrak{S}_{\left(r,s\right)}\mathcal{I}_{S^{1}\times S^{3}}\left(p,q,t\right).
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
For the case of single D3', let 
\begin_inset Formula $M=\mathbb{R}^{3}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma=T^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 D3' creates a line defect wrapping 
\begin_inset Formula $S^{1}$
\end_inset

 and it acts on quantum Hilbert space of a spin chain as a transfer matrix,
 since now we have non-compact three-manifold 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{3}$
\end_inset

.
 The line defect in the four-dimensional theory is realized as a Wilson-'t
 Hooft line operator 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

, and its magnetic and electric charge 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\mathbf{m},\mathbf{e}\right)$
\end_inset

 is specified by the one-cycle C' wrapping the torus 
\begin_inset Formula $T^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 As it turns out, the vacuum expectation values (vevs) of Wilson-'t Hooft
 lines realize the deformation quantization of the Hitchin moduli space,
 and are naturally quantized by the Weyl quantization: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\textrm{Weyl quantization of }\left\langle T_{\left(\mathbf{m},\mathbf{e}\right)}\right\rangle =\textrm{trigonometric transfer matrix.}
