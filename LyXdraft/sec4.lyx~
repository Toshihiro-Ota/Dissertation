\begin_layout Section
Surface defects as transfer matrices
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section, we apply the general construction of integrable lattice
 models from branes in string theory to the simplest case of the so-called
 class 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{S}$
\end_inset

 theories.
 Taking the four-manifold to be 
\begin_inset Formula $S^{1}\times S^{3}$
\end_inset

, on which quiver gauge theories are defined, the path integral of the twisted
 partition function of the theory computes the supersymmetric index.
 We first explain the correspondence between the supersymmetric index and
 the partition function of two-dimensional integrable lattice model.
 Then we proceed to the additional surface defects in the gauge theory side.
 The surface defects act on the supersymmetric index by difference operators,
 and they are identified with the transfer matrices of the corresponding
 integrable lattice model.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Brane tilings and integrable lattice models 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to give the general argument of the correspondence, let me briefly
 review the systematic brane construction of quiver gauge theories called
 
\emph on
brane tilings
\emph default
.
 For more details, the reader should be referred to the original paper and
 the excellent reviews [Hanany et al, Kennaway, Yamazaki].
 Recall the 5-brane configuration given in the last part of the previous
 section (equation of D5NS5), 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
N\,\mathrm{D5} & \quad S^{1}\times M\times\Sigma,\\
\mathrm{NS5}_{i} & \quad S^{1}\times N_{i}\times\Sigma_{i}.
\end{align*}

\end_inset

For such a configuration, what one needs to notice is that when an NS5-brane
 meets 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 D5-branes, they combine to form a bound state.
 In the language of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(p,q\right)$
\end_inset

 5-branes, this bound state is either an 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(N,1\right)$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(N,-1\right)$
\end_inset

 5-brane, depending on the relative positions of the branes; see figure.
 Therefore, the extended defects 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{E}_{\mathrm{NS5}_{i}}$
\end_inset

 are domain walls in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathsf{T}_{\mathrm{D5}}$
\end_inset

 separate the spacetime into the regions with different values of the NS5-brane
 charge 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

.
 The curves 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{i}$
\end_inset

 along which these domain walls are located are known as 
\emph on
zig-zag paths
\emph default
.
 Across a zig-zag path the charge 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 jump by one.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Conversely, given a configuration of curves 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{i}$
\end_inset

 on the two-dimensional surface 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma$
\end_inset

 and a 5-brane charge assignment consistent with it, we can construct a
 5-brane system whose zig-zag paths are 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{i}$
\end_inset

: we take 
\size normal
NS5-branes approaching the D5-branes from transverse directions, and let
 them meet along 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{i}$
\end_inset

 and form bound states over regions with 
\begin_inset Formula $q\neq0$
\end_inset

.
 Such a 5-brane system is called a brane tiling on 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma$
\end_inset

 [Hanany-Kennaway, Franco et al].
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we just explained, a brane tiling gives rise to a four-dimensional 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{N}=1$
\end_inset

 theory.
 A concrete description of this theory is known for the subset of brane
 tilings that involve only 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(N,0\right)$
\end_inset

 5-branes (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 coincident D5-branes) and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(N,\pm1\right)$
\end_inset

 5-branes.
 Given a brane tiling in this subset, we indicate 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(N,1\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(N,-1\right)$
\end_inset

 5-brane regions by dark and light shading, respectively, while leaving
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(N,0\right)$
\end_inset

 regions unshaded.
 After the shading, we get a checkerboard-like pattern on 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma$
\end_inset

 where shaded faces adjoin unshaded ones and two shaded faces sharing a
 vertex are of different types, see figure.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each unshaded region supports 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 D5-branes, hence an 
\begin_inset Formula $SU(N)$
\end_inset

 vector multiplet lives there.
 If the region contains part of the boundary, the multiplet is frozen by
 boundary conditions and the associated symmetry is an 
\begin_inset Formula $SU(N)$
\end_inset

 flavor symmetry; in quiver notation, we represent a dynamical vector multiplet
 by a gauge node (circle) and a non-dynamical one by a flavor node (square).
 From open strings stretched between two unshaded regions (namely ending
 on 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 D5-branes partitioned by NS5-brane) sharing a vertex, we get a chiral multiplet
 that transforms in the fundamental representation under one of the associated
 gauge or flavor groups and in the anti-fundamental representation under
 the other.
 We write it by an arrow between the two nodes: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
bifundamental\label{eq:bifund}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 The arrow points from the anti-fundamental side to the fundamental side.
 See figure for examples of quivers obtained from brane tilings.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moreover, for every set of zig-zag paths bounding a shaded region, we have
 a loop of arrows and world-sheet instantons generate a superpotential term
 given by the trace of the product of the bifundamental chiral multiplets
 in the loop.
 The coefficient of this term is positive or negative depending on whether
 the direction of the loop is clockwise or counterclockwise.
 Thus, the four-dimensional theory realized by a brane tiling in the subset
 under consideration is an 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{N}=1$
\end_inset

 supersymmetric gauge theory described by a quiver with potential drawn
 on 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each NS5
\begin_inset Formula $_{i}$
\end_inset

 supports a 
\begin_inset Formula $U(1)$
\end_inset

 flavor symmetry 
\begin_inset Formula $U(1)_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 An arrow is charged under 
\begin_inset Formula $U(1)_{i}$
\end_inset

 if it is crossed by 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 The charge 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{i}$
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $U(1)_{i}$
\end_inset

 can be normalized in such a way that the arrow in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:bifund"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 has 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{i}=-1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{j}=+1$
\end_inset

.
 The diagonal combination of all 
\begin_inset Formula $U(1)_{i}$
\end_inset

 acts on the theory trivially since every arrow is crossed by exactly two
 zig-zag paths from the opposite sides.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The theory also has an R-symmetry 
\begin_inset Formula $U(1)_{R}$
\end_inset

.
 Its definition is not unique as the R-charge 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 can be shifted by a linear combination of 
\begin_inset Formula $U(1$
\end_inset

) flavor charges.
 However, the R-charge assignment is constrained by two conditions.
 The first is that 
\begin_inset Formula $U(1)_{R}$
\end_inset

 must be unbroken by the superpotential and therefore the R-charges of the
 chiral multiplets contained in each superpotential term must add up to
 two.
 The second is that 
\begin_inset Formula $U(1)_{R}$
\end_inset

 must be free of anomaly.
 This requires that for every gauge node, the sum of the R-charges of the
 arrows starting from or ending at that node must equal the number of the
 arrows minus two.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To fix the R-charge assignment, let us assume that we can orient the zig-zag
 paths and bound every shaded or unshaded region with zig-zag paths all
 heading upward, for some choice of the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

vertical
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 direction in the neighborhood of that region.
 This is the case for the examples in figure.
 The zig-zag paths thus oriented fall into two groups; when a zig-zag path
 goes upward and we cross it from the left to the right, 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 increases by one.
 We distinguish the latter case from the former by drawing the zig-zag path
 with a dotted line.
 Then, we give an arrow 
\begin_inset Formula $R=0$
\end_inset

 if it originates from a crossing of two zig-zag paths of the same type,
 and 
\begin_inset Formula $R=1$
\end_inset

 otherwise.
 With this R-charge assignment the two conditions describe above are satisfied
 (figure).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Summarizing the rules for assignment of the charges, we can read off the
 quiver diagram from zig-zag paths as in figure.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Integrable lattice models from quiver gauge theories
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From the supersymmetric index of the four-dimensional 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{N}=1$
\end_inset

 theory realized by a brane tiling, we obtain an integrable lattice model
 defined on the lattice 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ C_{i}\right\} $
\end_inset

 consisting of the zig-zag paths.
 Each 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{i}$
\end_inset

 carries a spectral parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 S-duality followed by T-duality on 
\begin_inset Formula $S^{1}$
\end_inset

 turns NS5
\begin_inset Formula $_{i}$
\end_inset

 into a D4-brane, and its coordinate on the dual circle 
\begin_inset Formula $\check{S}^{1}$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 Instead, we can apply T-duality on 
\begin_inset Formula $S^{1}$
\end_inset

 and lift NS5
\begin_inset Formula $_{i}$
\end_inset

 to an M5-brane, then 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{i}$
\end_inset

 is the coordinate on the M-theory circle.
 Either way, 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{i}$
\end_inset

 is determined by the holonomy of the U(1) gauge field on NS5
\begin_inset Formula $_{i}$
\end_inset

 along 
\begin_inset Formula $S^{1}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the theory is described by a quiver, translation between the gauge theory
 and the lattice model goes as follows [Yamazaki^2].
 Nodes are interpreted as spin sites.
 For each flavor node, we can turn on a holonomy of the associated gauge
 field.
 The index depends on the conjugacy class of the holonomy, which is uniquely
 represented by a diagonal matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{diag}(z_{1},\ldots,z_{N})$
\end_inset

 up to permutations of the entries.
 The index is therefore a symmetric function of the U(1)-valued variables
 
\begin_inset Formula $(z_{1},\ldots,z_{N})$
\end_inset

 obeying the constraint 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{1}\cdots z_{N}=1$
\end_inset

.
 These variables are fugacities for the 
\begin_inset Formula $SU(N)$
\end_inset

 flavor symmetry and parametrize the value of the spin at this node, and
 thus the spins take values in the maximal torus 
\begin_inset Formula $U(1)^{N-1}$
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $SU(N)$
\end_inset

.
 For a gauge node, integration is performed over the fugacities since its
 gauge field is a path integral variable.
 This is the summation over the values of a spin placed on an internal face.
 Finally, arrows represent interactions between spins.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The unitarity relations are satisfied if the contributions to the index
 from arrows with 
\begin_inset Formula $R=0$
\end_inset

 are properly normalized.
 For example, consider the relation
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
unitarityrelation\label{eq:unitarity_delta}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 where the right-hand side is a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

delta function
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that equates two flavor nodes when one of them is gauged.
 The precise meaning will be given for the 
\begin_inset Formula $S^{1}\times S^{3}$
\end_inset

 case below.
 The theory on the left-hand side is SQCD with 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 colors and 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 flavors.
 If exhibits confinement and has a vacuum in which the mesons take nonzero
 expectation values and the flavor symmetry 
\begin_inset Formula $SU(N)\times SU(N)$
\end_inset

 is broken to the diagonal subgroup [Seiberg].
 The index computed in this vacuum is given by the right-hand side, provided
 that we cancel the contributions from the surviving baryon and anti-baryon.
 Another unitarity relation
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
anotherunitarity
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 holds since the two arrows on the left-hand side form a loop and generates
 a mass term in the superpotential.
 We can send the mass to infinity so that these arrows decouple from the
 theory, and are left with the right-hand side.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Yang-Baxter equation with three zig-zag paths is harder to understand,
 as it always involves and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(N,q\right)$
\end_inset

 region with 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|q\right|>1$
\end_inset

 and a quiver description is not available.
 The problem stems from the fact that our effects are domain walls across
 which 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 changes.
 To circumvent the difficulty, we take a pair of zig-zag paths of different
 types and think of it as a single line:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
doubleandsinglelines
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 This line does not alter the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

.
 Taking two copies of this line and placing them in an 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(N,-1\right)$
\end_inset

 background, we can make the R-matrix
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
R-matrix\label{eq:R_N-1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 A lattice model constructed from this R-matrix is a vertex model whose
 quiver consists diamonds of arrows (see figure).
 The vector space carried by a line is the space of symmetric functions
 of fugacities 
\begin_inset Formula $(z_{1},\ldots,z_{N})$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Alternatively, we can place these lines in an 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(N,0\right)$
\end_inset

 background and force them to exchange their constituent zig-zag paths as
 they cross:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
anotherR-matrix\label{eq:R_N0}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 This R-matrix leads to an IRF model described by a quiver with triangles
 of arrows, as shown in figure.
 The corresponding Yang-Baxter equation, after cancellation of some factors
 with the help of the unitarity relation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:unitarity_delta"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, reads
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
Seibergduality
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 The two sides are related by Seiberg duality [Seiberg] for SQCD with 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 colors and 
\begin_inset Formula $2N$
\end_inset

 flavors, so their indices are indeed equal.
 The Yang-Baxter equation in the lattice model in this case is hence also
 identified with the Seiberg duality in gauge theory side.
 The Yang-Baxter equation for the R-matrix 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:R_N-1"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, though more complicated, also follows from this equality.
 The relation between the Yang-Baxter move and Seiberg duality was first
 pointed out in [Hanany-Vegh] and established in [Yamazaki].
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Based on these observations, in the next subsection we argue that given
 the four-manifold 
\begin_inset Formula $S^{1}\times S^{3}$
\end_inset

 the supersymmtric index indeed matches the partition function of the integrable
 lattice model called Bazhanov-Sergeev model.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Supersymmetric index on 
\begin_inset Formula $S^{1}\times S^{3}$
\end_inset

 and an integrable lattice model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now we focus on the case 
\begin_inset Formula $M=S^{3}$
\end_inset

, in which geometry the supersymmetric index is well-studied from the work
 by [Romelsberger, Kinney et al, Festuccia-Seiberg].
 Parametrize 
\begin_inset Formula $S^{3}$
\end_inset

 by two complex variables 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\zeta_{p},\zeta_{q}\right)$
\end_inset

 satisfying 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\zeta_{p}\right|^{2}+\left|\zeta_{q}\right|^{2}=1$
\end_inset

, and denote the isometry groups acting on 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta_{p}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta_{q}$
\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $U(1)_{p}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $U(1)_{q}$
\end_inset

, respectively.
 We take 
\begin_inset Formula $S^{1}\times S^{3}$
\end_inset

 to be a twisted product; we prepare a trivial 
\begin_inset Formula $S^{3}$
\end_inset

-fibration over an interval 
\begin_inset Formula $[0,\beta]$
\end_inset

 and identify the fibers at the ends of the base using an isometry 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(e^{i\theta_{p}},e^{i\theta_{q}}\right)\in U(1)_{p}\times U(1)_{q}$
\end_inset

.
 On this spacetime, the partition function of the quiver gauge theory realized
 by a brane tiling gives the supersymmetric index refined by the isometries
 and the flavor symmetries.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The index is defined as a trace of refined Boltzmann weight over the space
 of states on 
\begin_inset Formula $S^{3}$
\end_inset

, which is computed exactly using state-operator correspondence in conformal
 case or by localization of the path integral.
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
superconformalindex
\]

\end_inset

The result is generically given by a combination of vector and chiral multiplets
 included in the theory.
 These multiplets are expressed in terms of the elliptic gamma function
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\Gamma\left(z;p,q\right)=\prod_{j,k=0}^{\infty}\frac{1-z^{-1}p^{j+1}q^{k+1}}{1-zp^{j}q^{k}}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

with 
\begin_inset Formula $p=e^{-\beta+i\theta_{p}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $q=e^{-\beta+i\theta_{q}}$
\end_inset

.
 To write down the formula, let 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{i}=e^{2\pi iu_{i}}$
\end_inset

 be the fugacity for the flavor group U(1)i associated with the 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

th zig-zag path.
 Also, we introduce the Pochhammar symble 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(z;q\right)_{\infty}=\prod_{k=0}^{\infty}\left(1-q^{k}z\right)$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A bifundamental chiral multiplet with R-charge 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 and U(1)i charge 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{i}$
\end_inset

 contributes to the index by the factor
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\prod_{I,J=1}^{N}\Gamma\left((pq)^{R/2}\prod_{i}a_{i}^{F_{i}}\frac{w_{I}}{z_{J}};p,q\right),
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{J}$
\end_inset

 are fugacities for the node at the tail of the arrow and 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{I}$
\end_inset

 are those for the node at the tip.
 To find the full index, we take the product of the contributions from all
 arrows, and then for each gauge node, integrate over its fugacities 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{I}$
\end_inset

 with the measure
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
vector
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 The integration contour is the unit circle for each fugacity.

\begin_layout Standard
The unitarity relation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:unitarity_delta"
plural "false"

\end_inset

 is satisfied if we normalize the contribution from each arrow with 
\begin_inset Formula $R=0$
\end_inset

 by dividing it by the factor 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma(\prod_{i}a_{i}^{NF_{i}};p,q)$
\end_inset

, which cancels the contribution from the corresponding baryon.
 The Yang-Baxter equation (eq:yang-baxter) is an integral identity obeyed
 by the elliptic gamma function [Dolan-Osborn, Spiridonov, Rains].
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two circles in 
\begin_inset Formula $S^{3}$
\end_inset

 around which we can place half-BPS surface defects without breaking the
 isometries, namely 
\begin_inset Formula $\{\zeta_{p}=0\}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\{\zeta_{q}=0\}$
\end_inset

.
 Accordingly, dashed lines come in two types, related by an interchange
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

.
 If a dashed line is in an 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-dimensional representation, the L-operator in an 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(N,-1\right)$
\end_inset

 background 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
L=
\end{equation}

\end_inset

may be represented as an 
\begin_inset Formula $n\times n$
\end_inset

 matrix, whose entries are difference operators acting on the fugacities
 for the flavor node associated with the 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(N,0\right)$
\end_inset

 region below the dashed line.
 It satisfies the RLL relation with the R-matrix 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref

\end_inset

 This R-matrix defines the Bazhanov-Sergeev model of type SU(N) [Bazhanov-Sergee
v].
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the fundamental representation of 
\begin_inset Formula $SU(2)$
\end_inset

, the above L-operator is essentially identified with Sklyanin's L-operator,

 model and generates the so-called Sklyanin algebra.
 For the fundamental representation of 
\begin_inset Formula $SU(N)$

 If instead placed in an

 quantum group for

 supersymmetric quiver gauge theories are vector multiplets and bifundamental
 chiral multiplets.
 A vector multiplet is present at a gauge node.
 A bifundamental chiral multiplet has two flavor groups, say

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $SU(N)_{w}$

The index 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{I}_{\mathcal{T}}$
\end_inset

 of a 4d 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{N}=1$
\end_inset

 theory 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{T}$
\end_inset

 with flavor group 
\begin_inset Formula $SU(N)_{z}$
\end_inset

 is a symmetric meromorphic function of the fugacities 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{1},\ldots,z_{N}$
\end_inset

.
 This symmetric property reflects the gauge invariance of the index.
 At the level of the index, gauging of a flavor group is realized by introductio
n of the corresponding vector multiplet and integration over its fugacities.
 In particular 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{I}_{\left(\mathcal{T}\times\mathcal{T}'\right)/SU(N)_{z}}=\int_{\mathbb{T}^{N-1}}\prod_{I=1}^{N-1}\frac{dz_{I}}{2\pi iz_{I}}\mathcal{I}_{V}(z)\mathcal{I}_{\mathcal{T}}(z)\mathcal{I}_{\mathcal{T}'}(z),
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 with the integration performed over the unit circle 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{T}$
\end_inset

 for each variable 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{I}$
\end_inset

.
 The index 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{I}_{\mathcal{T}}(z)$
\end_inset

 of the vector multiplet is given by elliptic gamma functions: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
z=\mathcal{I}_{\mathcal{T}}(z;p,q)=\frac{\left(p;p\right)_{\infty}^{N-1}\left(q;q\right)_{\infty}^{N-1}}{N!}\prod_{I,J=1(I\neq J)}^{N}\frac{1}{\Gamma(z_{I}/z_{J};p,q)}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 See appendix ?? for the definition of the elliptic gamma function and various
 identities it satisfies.
 From now on we fix 
\begin_inset Formula $p.\,q$
\end_inset

 and omit them from the notation unless needed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The index of a bifundamental chiral multiplet with fugacity 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 is given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
a=\mathcal{I}_{B}(z,w;a)=\prod_{I,J=1}^{N}\Gamma\left(a\frac{w_{I}}{z_{J}}\right).
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 This function satisfies 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{I}_{B}(z,w;a)\mathcal{I}_{B}\left(w,z;\frac{pq}{a}\right)=1.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 This identity says that as far as the index is concerned, we can cancel
 a pair of arrows making a loop if their R-charges add up to 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

 and flavor charges add up to 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
a=.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 Physically, the reason is that we can turn on mass term for such a pair.
 The index is invariant under this deformation, and the bifundamental chiral
 multiplets decouple from the theory if we send the mass to infinity, leaving
 a trivial contribution to the index.
 We will make use of this identity frequently.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end{equation}

\end{equation}

\end_inset

 then we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
a-a^{-1} & =\int_{\mathbb{T}^{N-1}}\prod_{I=1}^{N-1}\frac{dx_{I}}{2\pi ix_{I}}\mathcal{I}_{V}(x)\mathcal{I}_{B}(z,x;a)\mathcal{I}_{B}\left(x,w;a^{-1}\right)\nonumber \\
 & =\Gamma\left(a^{\pm N}\right)delta.
\end{align}

\end_inset

®This is a consequence of confinement and chiral symmetry breaking [Seiberg,
 Spiridonov-Vartanov].
 At low energies the theory on the left-hand side is described by the mesons
 and the baryons.
 It has a vacuum in which the mesons take nonzero expectation values and
 the flavor symmetry 
\begin_inset Formula $SU(N)_{w}\times SU(N)_{z}$
\end_inset

 is broken to the diagonal subgroup.
 In this vacuum the fugacities 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 are identified, so we get the quiver on the second line.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma(a^{\pm N}):=\Gamma(a^{N})\Gamma(a^{-N})$
\end_inset

 is the contribution from the baryons.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can readily write down the formula for the index of a general quiver
 gauge theory.
 For simplicity, suppose that the theory is described by a quiver that contains
 no flavor node.
 Then, the index is computed by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\prod_{z}\int_{\mathbb{T}^{N-1}}\prod_{I=1}^{N-1}\frac{dz_{I}}{2\pi iz_{I}}\mathcal{I}_{V}(z)\prod_{x\rightarrow y}\mathcal{I}_{B}(x,y),\label{eq:fullindex}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 where the two products are taken over all nodes and all arrows, respectively.
 the index is a function of the parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $p,\,q$
\end_inset

 and the flavor fugacities 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{i}$
\end_inset

, which are suppressed in the above expression.
 If the quiver contains flavor nodes, the index is also a function of their
 fugacities.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the expression of the supersymmetric index 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:fullindex"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, it is manifest that the index of a quiver gauge theory may be interpreted
 as the partition function of a statistical mechanical model with continuous
 spins.
 Indeed, this formula precisely computes the partition function of a spin
 model in which spins are placed at the gauge nodes.
 The spin variables at 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 are the fugacities 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{1},\ldots,z_{N}$
\end_inset

, and they interact among themselves as well as with spins at nearest-neighbor
 nodes, namely those connected by arrows.
 The Boltzmann weights for the self-interaction and the nearest-neighbor
 interaction are 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{I}_{V}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{I}_{B}$
\end_inset

, respectively.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Surface defects and L-operators
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now we introduce a half-BPS surface defect, and put it on 
\begin_inset Formula $S^{1}\times S^{1}\subset S^{3}\times S^{1}$
\end_inset

.
 The first 
\begin_inset Formula $S^{1}$
\end_inset

 factor may be taken to be either 
\begin_inset Formula $\{\zeta_{1}=0\}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\{\zeta_{2}=0\}$
\end_inset

 in the parametrization 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\zeta_{1}\right|^{2}+\left|\zeta_{2}\right|^{2}=1$
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $S^{3}$
\end_inset

.
 These are the circles in 
\begin_inset Formula $S^{3}$
\end_inset

 that are left invariant under the action of the isometry group 
\begin_inset Formula $U(1)_{p}\times U(1)_{q}$
\end_inset

.
 As explained in section ??, the index in the presence of the surface defect
 is again given by a correlation function os line operators in a 2d TQFT
 on 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma$
\end_inset

.
 The correlator now contains a new line operator created by the D3-brane
 ending on the D5-branes, which was denoted by dashed line: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
dashedline.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 This line operator is specified by a representation of 
\begin_inset Formula $SU(N)$
\end_inset

 [Gadde-Gukov, Gukov-Witten].
 In fact, it is labeled with a pair of representations 
\begin_inset Formula $(R_{1},R_{2})$
\end_inset

 since in general we can take superposition of two surface defects, each
 wrapped around either circle in 
\begin_inset Formula $S^{3}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In any case, the correlation function equals the partition function of a
 lattice model whose lattice is made of two kinds of lines, zig-zag paths
 coming from NS5-branes and the dashed line coming from the D3-branes.
 An extra dimension emerges as the M-theory circle if the brane system is
 embedded in the M-theory via T-duality along the second 
\begin_inset Formula $S^{1}$
\end_inset

 factor.
 Under this embedding, the D3-branes are mapped to M2-branes supported at
 points on the M-theory circle.
 Thus, the inclusion of the dashed line does not spoil the integrability
 of the lattice model.
 Moreover, by deforming the zig-zag paths near the dashed line, we can always
 make the neighborhood of the dashed line look like 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
dashedandsolids\label{eq:transferL}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

in some 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(N,q\right)$
\end_inset

 5-brane background.
 Each crossing of a solid line and the dashed one gives us an R-operator,
 which we call L-operator.
 Thus we conclude that the surface defect is represented in the lattice
 model by the insertion of a transfer matrix constructed from L-operators.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us consider the simplest interesting setup where we have just two D5-branes
 and a single D3-brane, and identify the concrete form of the transfer matrix
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:transferL"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 in this case.
 For 
\begin_inset Formula $N=2$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(N,q\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(N,q+2\right)$
\end_inset

 5-branes are related by an 
\begin_inset Formula $SL(2;\mathbb{Z})$
\end_inset

 transformation of type IIB string theory.
 Therefore, we can go to a duality frame in which the transfer matrix only
 involves either 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(N,0\right)$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(N,-1\right)$
\end_inset

 regions or 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(N,0\right)$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(N,1\right)$
\end_inset

 regions.
 The two cases are on an equal footing, and in fact related in a simple
 way, as we will see.
 We first consider the transfer matrix in the 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(N,-1\right)$
\end_inset

 background.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We denote the L-operator in this case by 
\begin_inset Formula $L^{\diamondsuit}$
\end_inset

 since it is the operator that arises when a dashed line is inserted in
 a brane tiling model described by the diamond quiver constructed from the
 R-operator (eq:diamond quiver).
 In the situation under consideration, the gauge group of a brane tiling
 model is a product of 
\begin_inset Formula $SU(2)$
\end_inset

 groups, and the surface defect is labeled 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(R_{1},R_{2}\right)=\left(\emptyset,fund\right)$
\end_inset

; the D3-brane wraps the circle 
\begin_inset Formula $\{\zeta_{2}=0\}$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $S^{3}$
\end_inset

.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $V^{\diamondsuit}$
\end_inset

 be the space of meromorphic functions 
\begin_inset Formula $f(z)$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $f(z)=f(1/z)$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $W=\mathbb{C}^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Then we can represent 
\begin_inset Formula $L^{\diamondsuit}:W\otimes V^{\diamondsuit}\rightarrow V^{\diamondsuit}\otimes W$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $2\times2$
\end_inset

 matrix whose entries are operators acting on functions in 
\begin_inset Formula $V^{\diamondsuit}$
\end_inset

.
 The R-matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{R}_{ij}^{\diamondsuit}:W_{i}\otimes W_{j}\rightarrow W_{j}\otimes W_{i}$
\end_inset

 is a 
\begin_inset Formula $4\times4$
\end_inset

 matrix.
 These operators, together with the R-operator 
\begin_inset Formula $R^{\diamondsuit}$
\end_inset

, satisfy the Yang-Baxter equations (4equations).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the other hand, in the context of integrable lattice models Sklyanin
 constructed an L-operator 
\begin_inset Formula $L^{\mathrm{S}}:W\otimes V^{\diamondsuit}\rightarrow V^{\diamondsuit}\otimes W$
\end_inset

 that solves the RLL relation [Sklyanin^2]
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{R}_{12}^{\mathrm{B}}(u_{1},u_{2})L_{1}^{\mathrm{S}}\left(u_{1},\left(\nu,l\right)\right)L_{2}^{\mathrm{S}}\left(u_{2},\left(\nu,l\right)\right)=L_{2}^{\mathrm{S}}\left(u_{2},\left(\nu,l\right)\right)L_{1}^{\mathrm{S}}\left(u_{1},\left(\nu,l\right)\right)\mathcal{R}_{12}^{\mathrm{B}}(u_{1},u_{2}),

\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{R}_{ij}^{\mathrm{B}}:W_{i}\otimes W_{j}\rightarrow W_{j}\otimes W_{i}$
\end_inset

 for the eight-vertex model [Baxter^2].
 Here 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{i}$
\end_inset

 is a complex spectral parameter for 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{i}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\nu,l\right)$
\end_inset

 is a pair of complex spectral parameters for 
\begin_inset Formula $V^{\diamondsuit}$
\end_inset

.
 Baxter's R-matrix solves the Yang-Baxter equation
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{R}_{12}^{\mathrm{B}}(u_{1},u_{2})\mathcal{R}_{13}^{\mathrm{B}}(u_{1},u_{3})\mathcal{R}_{23}^{\mathrm{B}}(u_{2},u_{3})=\mathcal{R}_{23}^{\mathrm{B}}(u_{2},u_{3})\mathcal{R}_{13}^{\mathrm{B}}(u_{1},u_{3})\mathcal{R}_{12}^{\mathrm{B}}(u_{1},u_{2}),
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 and the solution is given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{R}_{ij}^{\mathrm{B}}(u_{i},u_{j})=P\sum_{a=0}^{3}w_{a}(u_{i}-u_{j})\sigma_{a}\otimes\sigma_{a},\quad\,w_{a}(u)=\frac{\theta_{a+1}(u+\eta)}{\theta_{a+1}(\eta)},

\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $P:W_{i}\otimes W_{j}\rightarrow W_{j}\otimes W_{i}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{a}$

\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{a+1}(u)=\theta_{a+1}(u|\tau)$
\end_inset

 are the Jacobi theta functions, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau,\,\eta$

 Sklyanin's L-operator is defined by

\end_inset

 The operators 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{S}_{a}^{(l)}$
\end_inset

 act on meromorphic functions 
\begin_inset Formula $f(\zeta)$
\end_inset

 as difference operators:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left(\mathbf{S}_{a}^{(l)}f\right)(\zeta)=i^{\delta_{a,0}}\frac{\theta_{a+1}(\eta)}{\theta_{a+1}(2\zeta)}\left(\theta_{a+1}(2\zeta-2\eta l)f(\zeta+\eta)-\theta_{a+1}(-2\zeta-2\eta l)f(\zeta-\eta)\right).
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 They generate the so-called Sklyanin algebra [Sklyanin^2].
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In [Derkachov-Spiridonov], Derkachov and Spiridonov constructed an R-operator
 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{ij}^{\mathrm{DS}}:V_{i}^{\diamondsuit}\otimes V_{j}^{\diamondsuit}\rightarrow V_{j}^{\diamondsuit}\otimes V_{i}^{\diamondsuit}$
\end_inset

 that satisfies the RLL relation
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
 & R_{12}^{\mathrm{DS}}\left(\left(\nu_{1},l_{1}\right),\left(\nu_{2},l_{2}\right)\right)L_{2}^{\mathrm{DS}}\left(u,\left(\nu_{2},l_{2}\right)\right)L_{1}^{\mathrm{DS}}\left(u,\left(\nu_{1},l_{1}\right)\right)\nonumber \\
 & =L_{1}^{\mathrm{DS}}\left(u,\left(\nu_{1},l_{1}\right)\right)L_{2}^{\mathrm{DS}}\left(u,\left(\nu_{2},l_{2}\right)\right)R_{12}^{\mathrm{DS}}\left(\left(\nu_{1},l_{1}\right),\left(\nu_{2},l_{2}\right)\right),
\end{align}

\end_inset

 The L-operator 
\begin_inset Formula $L^{\mathrm{DS}}:W\otimes V^{\diamondsuit}\rightarrow V^{\diamondsuit}\otimes W$
\end_inset

 is essentially Sklyanin's L-operator, differing only by an automorphism
 of the Sklyanin algebra:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
L^{\mathrm{DS}}\left(u,\left(\nu,l\right)\right)=\varphi\sigma_{3}L^{\mathrm{S}}\varphi^{-1},\quad\,\left(\varphi f\right)(\zeta):=\exp(\pi i\zeta^{2}/\eta)f(\zeta).
\end{equation}

\end_inset

This L-operator also satisfies the RLL relation with Baxter's R-matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{R}^{\mathrm{B}}$
\end_inset

.
 At this point, what is important is that they show their R-operator 
\begin_inset Formula $R^{\mathrm{DS}}$
\end_inset

 is precisely the R-operator for the diamond quiver in the brane tiling
 model 
\begin_inset Formula $R^{\diamondsuit}$
\end_inset

, that is, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
R_{ij}^{\mathrm{DS}}\left(\left(\nu_{i},l_{i}\right),\left(\nu_{j},l_{j}\right)\right)=R_{ij}^{\diamondsuit}\left(\left(a_{i},b_{i}\right),\left(a_{j},b_{j}\right)\right),
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 with the variables 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 are related by 
\begin_inset Formula $z=\exp(2\pi i\zeta)$
\end_inset

 and the parameters matched as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
a_{i}b_{i} & =\exp(-2\pi i\nu_{i}),\quad\,\frac{a_{i}}{b_{i}}=\exp(2\pi i\eta(2l_{i}+1)),\\
\left(p,q\right) & =\left(\exp(2\pi i\tau),\exp(4\pi i\eta)\right).
\end{align}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Based on these observations, we propose that the L-operator for the diamond
 quiver 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
L^{\diamondsuit}\left(c,\left(a,b\right)\right)=
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 is the L-operator of Derkachov and Spiridonov:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
L^{\mathrm{DS}}\left(u,\left(\nu,l\right)\right)=L^{\diamondsuit}\left(c,\left(a,b\right)\right).
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 Requiring 
\begin_inset Formula $L^{\diamondsuit}\left(c,\left(a,b\right)\right)=L^{\diamondsuit}\left(1,\left(a/c,b/c\right)\right)$
\end_inset

 fixes the relation between the two spectral parameters for the dashed line
 to be
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
c=\exp(\pi iu).
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the computation of the transfer matrix, we exploit the fact that 
\begin_inset Formula $L^{\diamondsuit}$
\end_inset

 really consists of three parts separated by zig-zag paths:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
L_{i}^{\diamondsuit}\left(c,\left(a_{i},b_{i}\right)\right)=.\label{eq:pieceL}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 Reflecting this structure, 
\begin_inset Formula $L^{\diamondsuit}$
\end_inset

 can be expressed in the following factorized form:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
L_{i}^{\diamondsuit}\left(c,\left(a_{i},b_{i}\right)\right)=B\left(z_{i};\frac{b_{i}}{c}\right)\cdot\varphi(z_{i})\frac{1}{\theta_{1}(z_{i}^{2})}\left(\begin{array}{cc}
\Delta_{i}^{1/2} & 0\\
0 & \Delta_{i}^{-1/2}
\end{array}\right)\varphi^{-1}(z_{i})\cdot A\left(z_{i};\frac{a_{i}}{c}\right).\label{eq:diamondL}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 In this expression, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta_{i}^{\pm1/2}$
\end_inset

 are difference operators acting on functions of 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{i}$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\Delta_{i}^{\pm1/2}f\right)(z_{i})=f(q^{\pm1/2}z_{i})$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
A(z;a)=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
\bar{\theta}_{4}(a/z) & \bar{\theta}_{3}(a/z)\\
\bar{\theta}_{4}(az) & \bar{\theta}_{3}(az)
\end{array}\right),\quad\,B(z;b)=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
\bar{\theta}_{3}(bz) & -\bar{\theta}_{3}(b/z)\\
\bar{\theta}_{4}(bz) & -\bar{\theta}_{4}(b/z)
\end{array}\right),
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\theta}_{a}(z)=\theta_{a}(z;\sqrt{p})$
\end_inset

 and we used the multiplicative notation for the theta functions.
 Roughly speaking, one can think of the three matrices in the expression
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 as corresponding to the left, middle and right parts of the above diagram.

\begin_layout Standard
The transfer matrix 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref

 is obtained by concatenating 
\begin_inset Formula $n$

 along a loop: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
concatenate.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 Thus, multiplying 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 copies of the L-operators 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:diamondL"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 and using formulas in the appendix, we obtain the following formula for
 the transfer matrix:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
 & \mathrm{Tr}_{W}\left(L_{n}^{\diamondsuit}\left(c,\left(a_{n},b_{n}\right)\right)\circ_{W}\cdots\circ_{W}L_{1}^{\diamondsuit}\left(c,\left(a_{1},b_{1}\right)\right)\right)\nonumber \\
 & =\sum_{s_{1}=\pm1}\cdots\sum_{s_{n}=\pm1}\prod_{i=1}^{n}\ell\left(z_{i-1}^{s_{i-1}},z_{i}^{s_{i}};\frac{b_{i-1}}{c},\frac{a_{i}}{c}\right)\prod_{j=1}^{n}\Delta_{j}^{s_{j}/2},\label{eq:proposal}
\end{align}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\ell\left(w,z;b,a\right)=\frac{1}{\theta(z^{2})}\theta\left(\sqrt{\frac{p}{q}}ba\frac{w}{z}\right)\theta\left(\sqrt{\frac{p}{q}}\frac{a}{b}\frac{1}{wz}\right).
\end{equation}

\end_inset

In this formula we have dropped off an overall constant independent of the
 spectral parameters.
 At any rate, the overall normalization of the L-operators cannot be determined
 by the RLL relations.
 The RLL relations actually admit more degrees of freedom than just the
 overall normalization.
 For example, we can multiply 
\begin_inset Formula $L^{\diamondsuit}\left(c,\left(a,b\right)\right)$
\end_inset

 by a function 
\begin_inset Formula $f(c,(a,b))$
\end_inset

 of its spectral parameters, and the new one still solves the RLL relations.
 In the next subsection we will check the proposal by comparing it with
 independent computations from gauge theory.

So far we have considered the surface defect labeled 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(R_{1},R_{2}\right)=\left(\emptyset,fund\right)$

 Of course, we may also consider the case with 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(R_{1},R_{2}\right)=\left(fund,\emptyset\right)$
\end_inset

 in the same manner, by letting surface defects wrap around the other 
\begin_inset Formula $S^{1}$

 Hence, there are two sets of L-operators related by the symmetry exchanging

 The underlying algebraic structure is the product of two copies of the

Building blocks of 4d

 supersymmetric quiver gauge theories are vector multiplets and bifundamental

Now we aim to check the proposal on surface defects and transfer matrices
 by comparing them with independent calculations.
 In this section we perform the simplest such check for surface defects
 in 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}$
\end_inset

 theories of class 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{S}$
\end_inset

 [Gaiotto, GMN], which arise from compactification of the 6d 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{N}=\left(2,0\right)$
\end_inset

 theory of type 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}$
\end_inset

 on punctured Riemann surfaces.
 The action of surface defects on the supersymmetric indices of class-
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{S}$

 Here we first review the computation for the surface defect labeled with
 the fundamental representation of

 based on the method developed in [GRR], and show that the result agrees
 with the prediction from the transfer matrix

Typical examples of class-

 gauge theories characterized by linear and circular quivers with

 They are actually also examples of brane tiling models discussed in the
 previous sections.
 As such, they allow us to translate key notions in class-

 So let us first describe these theories as class-
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{S}$

 theories as well as brane tiling models, and understand the relation between
 the two descriptions.
 Although we will mainly work with 
\begin_inset Formula $N=2$

 general.

This brane configuration is lifted in M-theory to M5-branes, wrapped on
 a cylinder with 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 punctures created by intersecting M5-branes.
 Therefore, the 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{N}=2$
\end_inset

 linear quiver theory is obtained by compactification of the 6d 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{N}=\left(2,0\right)$
\end_inset

 theory of type 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{N-1}$
\end_inset

 on a cylinder with 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $m+2$
\end_inset

 punctures.
 We distinguish the two punctures coming from the ends of the cylinder from
 the 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 punctures in between.
 They are referred to as maximal and minimal punctures, respectively.
 In the class-
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{S}$
\end_inset

 language, the 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{N}=2$
\end_inset

 linear quiver theory is a theory associated to a sphere with 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

 maximal and 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 minimal punctures, see figure.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
R-symmetry of the theory is 
\begin_inset Formula $SU(2)_{I}\times U(1)_{r}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $SU(2)_{I}$
\end_inset

 represents the rotation symmetry of the 789-space, and 
\begin_inset Formula $U(1)_{r}$
\end_inset

 the rotation symmetry of the 45-plane.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $SU(N)$
\end_inset

 flavor node from each end of the quiver is associated to the maximal puncture
 on the corresponding side of the sphere.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

th gauge node is associated to the tube between the 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

th and 
\begin_inset Formula $(i+1)$

 To the

th minimal puncture is associated a flavor symmetry 
\begin_inset Formula $U(1)_{i}$
\end_inset

 which acts on the hypermultiplet charged under the 
\begin_inset Formula $(i-1)$
\end_inset

th and 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

th gauge nodes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Following the philosophy of class-
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{S}$
\end_inset

 theories, we decompose this theory into basic building blocks by decoupling
 gauge fields.
 Roughly, the gauge coupling of the 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

th gauge node is inversely proportional to the length between the 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

th and 
\begin_inset Formula $(i+1)$
\end_inset

th minimal punctures.
 To make the gauge couplings small, we take the minimal punctures far apart
 from one another.
 Then the surface looks like a string of 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 spheres, each containing a single minimal puncture, connected by long tubes.
 The smaller the gauge couplings get, the longer the tubes become, and eventuall
y these spheres split up as the couplings go to zero.
 Each of the spheres represents a bifundamental hypermultiplet, which is
 a linear quiver with 
\begin_inset Formula $m=1$
\end_inset

, so it has one minimal and two maximal punctures.
 The quiver thus breaks into a collection of three-punctured spheres, or
 trinions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Conversely, a sphere with two maximal and 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 minimal punctures is obtained by gluing 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 trinions together, namely by replacing pairs of maximal punctures with
 tubes.
 In general, we can connect two Riemann surfaces with a tube at maximal
 punctures.
 From the point of view of gauge theory, gluing corresponds to gauging the
 diagonal combination of the SU(N) flavor symmetries associated to the maximal
 punctures involved.
 Using trinions with one minimal and two maximal punctures, we can obtain
 any linear quiver in this way, and for that manner also a circular quiver
 by further gluing the two ends of a linear quiver together.
 In this sense, these trinions are building blocks for linear and circular
 quivers.
 As these two kinds of quivers can be treated essentially in the same manner,
 we will focus on linear quivers in the followings.

\begin_layout Standard
To make contact with brane tilings, what we need to do is to find the counterpar
t of trinion, building block of quiver gauge theories, in brane tiling systems.
 To do this, we describe the 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{N}=2$
\end_inset

 linear quiver theory as an 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{N}=1$
\end_inset

 quiver gauge theory.
 In terms of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{N}=1$
\end_inset

 supermultiplets, the 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{N}=2$
\end_inset

 vector multiplet for the 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

th gauge node decomposes into a vector multiplet and a chiral multiplet
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi_{i}$
\end_inset

 in the adjoint representation with 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(r,I_{3}\right)=\left(-1,0\right)$
\end_inset

th hypermultiplet consists of two bifundamental chiral multiplets 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{i},\,\tilde{Q}_{i}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(r,I_{3}\right)=\left(0,1/2\right)$
\end_inset

 Here 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{3}$
\end_inset

 is a Cartan generator of 
\begin_inset Formula $SU(2)_{I}$
\end_inset

 The pair 
\begin_inset Formula $(Q_{i},\tilde{Q}_{i}^{\dagger})$
\end_inset

 transforms in the doublet of 
\begin_inset Formula $SU(2)_{I}$
\end_inset

 and have 
\begin_inset Formula $U(1)_{i}$
\end_inset

 charge 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{i}=-1$
\end_inset

 From the point of view of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{N}=1$
\end_inset

 supersymmetry, the U(1) symmetry generated by the combination 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{F}=r+I_{3}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

is a flavor symmetry.
 We denote the fugacity for 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}$
\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 For the standard definition of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{N}=2$
\end_inset

 index, 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}$
\end_inset

 enter the trace through the combination 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(pq\right)^{-r}t^{\mathcal{F}}$

 THen, the fugacities of 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{i},\,\tilde{Q}_{i}$

\end_inset

 are 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{t}/\alpha_{i}$

\begin_layout Standard
It is helpful for us to prepare two copies for each node of the quiver and
 impose identification between them.
 We draw the arrows in such a way that 
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi_{i}$
\end_inset

 connects the two copies of the 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

th node and makes a triangle with 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{Q}_{i}$
\end_inset

, as in figure.
 Drawn in this form, it is clear that the 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{N}=2$
\end_inset

 linear quiver is a special case of the triangle quiver described in section
 ??, except that the vertical arrow is missing between the flavor nodes
 at the right end.
 The corresponding brane tiling diagram is therefore essentially the same,
 as shown in figure.
 Note that the cubic superpotentials, generated around the triangles by
 world-sheet instantons, are precisely what we need for the theory to have
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{N}=2$
\end_inset

 supersymmetry.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we can split the (
\begin_inset Formula $m+1$
\end_inset

)-punctured sphere into a collection of 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 trinioins, we can also break the brane tiling diagram into basic pieces.
 Each piece represents a single trinioin and is made of three zig-zag paths,
 see figure??.
 Gluing two trinions corresponds to concatenating two such diagrams side
 by side.
 In the course of this operation, we must interchange the positions of the
 zig-zag paths labeled 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 near the glued side of one of the diagrams.
 This results in an additional vertical arrow in the combined quiver, which
 is the adjoint chiral multiplet in the 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{N}=2$
\end_inset

 vector multiplet used in the gauging.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us find the relationship between the convention we use for brane tilings
 and that used above.
 The R-charge 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 in the brane tiling model is given in terms of the charges of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{N}=2$
\end_inset

 theory by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
R=R_{0}+\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i}F_{i},\quad\,R_{0}=-r+I_{3}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 The flavor charges associated to the zig-zag paths can be written as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
F_{a_{i}}=-F_{i},\quad\,F_{b}=-\mathcal{F}+\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i}F_{i},\quad\,F_{c}=\mathcal{F}+\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i}F_{i}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Without loss of generality, we can set
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
a_{i}=\frac{1}{\alpha_{i}}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Plugging these relations into the combination 
\begin_inset Formula $(pq)^{R/2}\prod_{i}a_{i}^{F_{a_{i}}}b^{F_{b}}c^{F_{c}}$
\end_inset

 that enters the indices of the bifundamental chiral multiplets, we deduce
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
b=\frac{1}{\sqrt{t}},\quad\,c=\sqrt{\frac{t}{pq}}.\label{eq:relation_bc}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Before proceeding, we should mention a peculiarity in the 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}$
\end_inset

 case.
 When 
\begin_inset Formula $N=2$
\end_inset

, the U(1) flavor symmetry of a bifundamental hypermultiplet is enhanced
 to SU(2) due to the fact that the fundamental representation of SU(2) is
 pseudoreal.
 For this reason there is no distinction between minimal and maxmal punctures,
 and each trinion can be regarded as a half-hypermultiplet in the trifundamental
 representation of 
\begin_inset Formula $SU(2)^{3}$
\end_inset

.
 This is reflected in the index of a trinion, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{I}_{B}(w,z;\sqrt{t}a)\mathcal{I}_{B}(z,w;\sqrt{t}/a)=\Gamma(\sqrt{t}\alpha^{\pm1}z^{\pm1}w^{\pm1}),
\end{equation}

\end_inset

which is manifestly symmetric under permutation of 
\begin_inset Formula $a,\,z$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

.

Surface defects in

\end_inset

 theories of class 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{S}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In [Gaiotto-Rastelli-Razamat], it was explained how to construct a surface
 defect labeled with a pair of integers (
\begin_inset Formula $r,s$
\end_inset

), and how to determine its action on the supersymmetric index.
 Although the method applies to general 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{N}=2$
\end_inset

 theories with SU(N) flavor symmetry, here we review it in the language
 of class-
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{S}$
\end_inset

 theories.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose we have a class-
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{S}$
\end_inset

 theory 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{IR}}$
\end_inset

 associated to a Riemann surface that contains a maximal puncture, whose
 flavor group we call 
\begin_inset Formula $SU(N)_{z}$
\end_inset

.
 To this surface we introduce an extra minimal puncture.
 Concretely, we can do this as follows.
 First, we rename the flavor group 
\begin_inset Formula $SU(N)_{z}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $SU(N)_{w'}$
\end_inset

.
 Then, we take trinion representing a hypermultiplet (
\begin_inset Formula $Q,\tilde{Q}$
\end_inset

) with flavor symmetry 
\begin_inset Formula $SU(N)_{w''}\times SU(N)_{z}\times U(1)_{\alpha}$
\end_inset

, and glue it to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{IR}}$
\end_inset

 by gauging the diagonal subgroup 
\begin_inset Formula $SU(N)_{w}$
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $SU(N)_{w'}\times SU(N)_{w''}$
\end_inset

.
 The resulting theory 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{UV}}$
\end_inset

 has one more flavor symmetry, 
\begin_inset Formula $U(1)_{\alpha}$
\end_inset

, than 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{IR}}$
\end_inset

.
 Correspondingly, the surface associated to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{UV}}$
\end_inset

 has one more minimal puncture than the original surface.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The theory 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{UV}}$
\end_inset

 is related to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{IR}}$
\end_inset

 via the RG flow induced by a diagonal constant vev given to the quark 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

, or equivalently, to the baryon 
\begin_inset Formula $B=\det Q$
\end_inset

.
 The vev higgses the gauge group 
\begin_inset Formula $SU(N)_{w}$
\end_inset

 and breaks 
\begin_inset Formula $SU(N)_{w}\times SU(N)_{z}$
\end_inset

 down to the diagonal subgroup.
 Moreover, it turns the cubic superpotential 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{Q}\Phi Q$
\end_inset

 into a quadratic one that makes 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{Q}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi$
\end_inset

 massive, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi$
\end_inset

 is the adjoint chiral multiplet introduced in the gluing.
 Up to Nambu-Goldstone multiplets that survive the higgsing, in the infrared
 the multiplets we added are gone and we recover 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{IR}}$
\end_inset

, with 
\begin_inset Formula $SU(N)_{w}$
\end_inset

 replaced with 
\begin_inset Formula $SU(N)_{z}$
\end_inset

.
 In effect, the minimal puncture introduced by gluing the trinion is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

closed.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 The R-charge 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{3}$
\end_inset

 is broken by the vev, but the combination 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{3}+F_{\alpha}/2$
\end_inset

 is preserved and identified with a Cartan generator of the infrared SU(2)
 R-symmetry.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To create a surface defect in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{IR}}$
\end_inset

, we instead give the baryon a position-dependent vev 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle B\right\rangle =\zeta_{1}^{r}\zeta_{2}^{s}$
\end_inset

.
 Here, as vefore, 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta_{2}$
\end_inset

 are complex coordinates of the two orthogonal planes rotated by 
\begin_inset Formula $j_{p}=j_{1}+j_{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $j_{q}=j_{1}-j_{2}$
\end_inset

, respectively.
 Away from the origin, the effect of the position-dependent vev is the same
 as that of the constant vev, so we get 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{IR}}$
\end_inset

 in the infrared.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $r\neq0$
\end_inset

, however, the infrared theory is modified on the plane 
\begin_inset Formula $\{\zeta_{1}=0\}$
\end_inset

 since the vev vanishes there.
 By the same token, the theory is modified on the plane 
\begin_inset Formula $\{\zeta_{2}=0\}$
\end_inset

 if 
\begin_inset Formula $s\neq0$
\end_inset

.
 Hence, in general we obtain 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{IR}}$
\end_inset

 with the insertion of a surface defect labeled with the pair of integers
 
\begin_inset Formula $(r,s)$
\end_inset

, supported on the planes 
\begin_inset Formula $\{\zeta_{1}=0\}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\{\zeta_{2}=0\}$
\end_inset

.
 This surface defect is to be identified with the surface defect labeled
 with the pair 
\begin_inset Formula $(r\,fund,s\,fund)$
\end_inset

 of symmetric representation of SU(N) discussed in the previous section
 [Gadde-Gukov].
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The index of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{UV}}$
\end_inset

 has a pole in the 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

-plane at 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=\sqrt{t}p^{r/N}q^{s/N}$
\end_inset

, and the residue there gives the index of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{IR}}$
\end_inset

 in the presence of the surface defect of type 
\begin_inset Formula $(r,s)$
\end_inset

.
 The reason is the following.
 The position-dependent vev 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle B\right\rangle =\zeta_{1}^{r}\zeta_{2}^{s}$
\end_inset

 breaks 
\begin_inset Formula $U(1)_{p}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $U(1)_{q}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $SU(2)_{I}$
\end_inset

.
 At this value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

, however, the only combinations of charges that enter the trace defining
 the index are those that are preserved by the vev.
 Thus, we can still define the index in this background.
 As explained above, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{UV}}$
\end_inset

 flows to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{IR}}$
\end_inset

 plus Nambu-Goldstone multiplets in the infrared.
 The latter contains massless degrees of freedom, and they contribute to
 the index by a diverging factor, in fact a simple pole in the 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

-plane.
 Therefore, the residue at this pole gives the index of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{IR}}$
\end_inset

, together with some factor associated with the Nambu-Goldstone multiplets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We wish to compute this residue and determine the action of the surface
 defect on the index in the simplest non-trivial case, namely when 
\begin_inset Formula $N=2$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $(r,s)=(0,1)$
\end_inset

.
 But first, let us look at the trivial case 
\begin_inset Formula $(r,s)=(0,0)$
\end_inset

 to gain intuition of the computation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the construction of a surface defect described above, 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{Q}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi$
\end_inset

 actually play no role.
 The essential point is that the vev given to the baryon built from 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 replaces 
\begin_inset Formula $SU(N)_{w}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $SU(N)_{z}$
\end_inset

 in the infrared.
 So we couple 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{IR}}$
\end_inset

 just to 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 for the moment.
 The index of the combined theory is given by
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\int_{\mathbb{T}}\frac{dw}{2\pi iw}\mathcal{I}_{\mathrm{V}}(w)\mathcal{I}_{\mathrm{B}}(z,w;\rho)\mathcal{I}_{\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{IR}}}(w)=\kappa\int_{\mathbb{T}}\frac{dw}{2\pi iw}\frac{\Gamma(\rho z^{\pm1}w^{\pm1})}{\Gamma(w^{\pm2})}\mathcal{I}_{\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{IR}}}(w),
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho=\sqrt{t}/a$
\end_inset

 is the fugacity of 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa=(p;p)_{\infty}(q;q)_{\infty}/2$
\end_inset

.
 In this integral, 
\begin_inset Formula $|\rho|<1$
\end_inset

 is assumed, but we can analytically continue 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 to a complex parameter and study its pole structure.
 At 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho=1$
\end_inset

, a constant vev be turned on for 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 without conflicting with the definition of the index.
 The integral should have a pole at this point in the 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

-plane, and we want to calculate the residue there.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The integrand has two pairs of poles in the 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

-plane at
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
w=\rho z,\,\rho^{-1}z;\quad\quad\,w=\rho z^{-1},\,\rho^{-1}z^{-1}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 As 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho\rightarrow1$
\end_inset

, the first pair of poles collide and pinch the integration contour, and
 the integral diverges.
 Likewise, the second pair also collide in this limit.
 The pole of the integral in the 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

-plane arises from the contributions from these poles in 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

.
 Using formula (eq:appendix), we find that the contribution from the pole
 at 
\begin_inset Formula $w=\rho z$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{2}\frac{\Gamma(\rho^{2}z^{2})\Gamma(z^{-2})}{\Gamma(\rho^{2}z^{2})\Gamma(\rho^{-2}z^{-2})}\Gamma(\rho^{2})\mathcal{I}_{\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{IR}}}(\rho z).
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 The last factor 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma(\rho^{2})$
\end_inset

 indeed has a pole at 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho=1$
\end_inset

, with residue 
\begin_inset Formula $1/4\kappa$
\end_inset

.
 The pole at 
\begin_inset Formula $w=\rho z^{-1}$
\end_inset

 makes an equal contribution, and we get
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{Res}_{\rho=1}\left[\int_{\mathbb{T}}\frac{dw}{2\pi iw}\mathcal{I}_{\mathrm{V}}(w)\mathcal{I}_{\mathrm{B}}(z,w;\rho)\mathcal{I}_{\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{IR}}}(w)\right]=\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2\kappa}\mathcal{I}_{\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{IR}}}(z).
\end{equation}

\end_inset

As expected, the residue reproduces the index of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{IR}}$
\end_inset

, multiplied by some factors.
 The factor of 
\begin_inset Formula $1/2$
\end_inset

 comes from the fact that 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 has fugacity 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho^{2}$
\end_inset

, and disappears if we add the equal contribution from the pole at 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho=-1$
\end_inset

.
 The factor 
\begin_inset Formula $1/2\kappa$
\end_inset

 is the contribution from a decoupled free chiral multiplet contained in
 a Nambu-Goldstone multiplet.
 It is the inverse of the index of a free vector multiplet since higgsing
 of a U(1) gauge theory with a single chiral multiplet leads to a trivial
 theory whose index is one.

\begin_layout Standard
In order to express this result in a concise form, we introduce the notation
 of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

striking out an arrow
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in a quiver diagram to indicate that a constant vev is given to the baryonic
 operator built from the bifundamental chiral multiplet represented by that
 arrow, and the notation, what we just found is the identity
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
=4\kappa\mathrm{Res}_{\rho=1}=,\label{eq:deltaidentity}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 where the right-hand side is the delta function defined by the relation
 (??).
 This identity holds when the index of any theory with SU(2) flavor symmetry
 (or more generally, any meromorphic function 
\begin_inset Formula $f(w)$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $f(w)=f(1/w)$
\end_inset

) is coupled to the right node.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the help of this identity, we can readily show that when a constant
 vev is turned on for 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

, the index of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{UV}}$
\end_inset

 reduces to that of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{IR}}$
\end_inset

.
 All we have to do is to look at the part of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{UV}}$
\end_inset

 describing the coupling to the trinion, and compute the relevant residue:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
=t=.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 In the first equality we use the identity 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:deltaidentity"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 and set 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho=1$
\end_inset

, and in the second we canceled the pair of arrows making a loop.
 Thus, the vev transforms the trinion into the original flavor node of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{IR}}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can compute the index of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{IR}}$
\end_inset

 in the presence of a surface defect in a similar manner.
 To indicate that the position-dependent vev 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle B\right\rangle =\zeta_{1}^{r}\zeta_{2}^{s}$
\end_inset

 is turned on, we put the label 
\begin_inset Formula $(r,s)$
\end_inset

 on the struck-out arrow:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
=4\kappa\mathrm{Res}_{\rho=p^{-r/2}q^{-s/2}}\label{eq:surfacedefect_residue}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 Then the action of the surface defect of type 
\begin_inset Formula $(r,s)$
\end_inset

 on the index is encoded in the diagram
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
(r,s).

\begin_layout Standard
Let us calculate the residue 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $(r,s)=(0,1)$
\end_inset

.
 At 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho=q^{-1/2}$
\end_inset

, the index 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{I}_{B}(z,w;\rho)=\Gamma(\rho z^{\pm1}w^{\pm1})$
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 has four sets of colliding poles in the 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

-plane.
 Two of them are 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
w=\rho qz,\,\rho^{-1}z;\quad\quad\,w=\rho z^{-1},\,\rho^{-1}q^{-1}z^{-1},
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 while the other two are 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
w=\rho qz^{-1},\,\rho^{-1}z^{-1};\quad\quad\,w=\rho z,\,\rho^{-1}q^{-1}z.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 The contributions to the residue come from these poles.
 A small calculation shows that the first two sets of poles contribute in
 the same way: they set 
\begin_inset Formula $w=q^{1/2}z$
\end_inset

 and give a factor of 
\begin_inset Formula $1/\theta(q^{-1})\theta(z^{2})$
\end_inset

 in total.
 Similarly, the contributions from the last two set 
\begin_inset Formula $w=q^{-1/2}z$
\end_inset

 and give a factor of 
\begin_inset Formula $1/\theta(q^{-1})\theta(z^{-2})$
\end_inset

.
 Altogether, we find that the result can be expressed as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
=\frac{1}{\theta(q^{-1})}\sum_{s=\pm1}\frac{1}{\theta(z^{2s})}\Delta^{s/2}
\end{equation}

 We remind the reader that 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta(z)=\theta(z;p)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta^{\pm1/2}$
\end_inset

 act on functions of 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\Delta^{\pm1/2}f\right)(z)=f(q^{\pm1/2}z)$
\end_inset

.

\begin_layout Standard
Unlike the case of the constant vev, this identity does not cause a complete
 cancelation of the indices of 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{Q}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi$
\end_inset

.
 Rather, for 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho=q^{-1/2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $w=q^{\pm1/2}z$
\end_inset

, we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
=\theta\left(\frac{t}{q}z^{\mp2}\right)\theta(t).
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Therefore, the effect of introducing the surface defect of type 
\begin_inset Formula $(0,1)$
\end_inset

 on the index is realized by the difference operator
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathfrak{S}_{(0,1)}=\frac{\theta(t)}{\theta(q^{-1})}\sum_{s=\pm1}\frac{1}{\theta(z^{2s})}\theta\left(\frac{t}{q}z^{-2}\right)\Delta^{s/2}.\label{eq:surfacedefectaction}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 The prefactor 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta(t)/\theta(q^{-1})$
\end_inset

 is equal to the index of a free chiral field in two dimensions, and represents
 the center-of-mass degree of freedom of the surface defect.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The difference operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathfrak{S}_{(0,1)}$
\end_inset

 acts on the fugacity for the maximal puncture on which the surface defect
 was constructed.
 This fact has a natural interpretation.
 To construct the surface defect, we first introduced an extra minimal puncture,
 and then took the residue of a pole in the fugacity of the associated flavor
 symmetry.
 The latter step can be thought of as transforming the minimal puncture
 to another kind of puncture which represents the surface defect.
 By construction, this puncture is located in the neighborhood of a maximal
 puncture contained in a trinion.
 We can take the surface defect puncture and collide it to the maximal puncture.
 The collision produces a new puncture, and defines the action of the surface
 defect on the maximal puncture.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Comparison with the transfer matrix
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us finally compare the result with the proposal.
 For clarity of presentation, take a minimal puncture in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{IR}}$
\end_inset

 and move it close to the maximal puncture on which the surface defect acts.
 Then the neighborhood of these punctures looks like a trinion glued to
 another maximal puncture, and is represented by zig-zag paths as in figure??.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
According to the proposal, the surface defect creates a dashed line with
 some spectral parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

, also drawn in the picture.
 It acts on the lattice model as the transfer matrix
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{Tr}\left(L^{\diamondsuit}\left(d,(c,b)\right)\right)=\sum_{s=\pm1}\frac{1}{\theta(z^{2s})}\theta\left(\sqrt{\frac{p}{q}}\frac{bc}{d^{2}}\right)\theta\left(\sqrt{\frac{p}{q}}\frac{c}{b}z^{-2s}\right)\Delta^{s/2}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 From the relation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "eq:relation_bc"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, we see that if we set
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
d=\frac{1}{\sqrt{qt}},
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 the transfer matrix indeed reproduces the difference operator 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:surfacedefectaction"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, up to an overall factor which cannot be fixed by the Yang-Baxter equations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As noted in [Gaiotto-Rastelli-Razamat], the above transfer matrix is essentially
 the Hamiltonian of elliptic Ruijsenaars-Schneider model [Ruijsenaars-Schneider,
 Ruijsenaars] of type 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 This fact follows from a general result obtained in [Hasegawa].
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here we have considered only the surface defect of type 
\begin_inset Formula $(0,1)$
\end_inset

, but the general story is similar.
 The surface defect of type 
\begin_inset Formula $(r,s)$
\end_inset

 acts on the index by a difference operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathfrak{S}_{(r,s)}$
\end_inset

.
 This operator is expected to coincide with the transfer matrix for an appropria
te L-operator.
 If so, by the RLL relation, the operators 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathfrak{S}_{(r,s)}$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $(r,s)$
\end_inset

 should commute with each other.
 This is indeed true [GRR].
 From the class-
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{S}$
\end_inset

 point of view, the mutual commutativity is guaranteed by the fact that
 the index is independent of the positions of punctures representing surface
 defects.
 Therefore, the order in which they act on a maximal puncture is irrelevant.
 Note that this argument also exploits the existence of an extra dimension,
 which is the M-theory circle that emerges as the type IIA brane configuration
 is lifted to M-theory.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the same reason, a surface defect puncture can be placed between any
 two punctures, whether minimal or maximal, and still yield the same result.
 From the point of view of the type IIA system, this property appears to
 be quite non-trivial and is known as the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

hopping invariance
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the index [Gadde-Gukov].
 From the lattice model viewpoint, this is guaranteed by the other RLL relation
 (??).
