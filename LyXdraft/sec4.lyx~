\begin_layout Section
Surface defects as transfer matrices
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Brane tilings and integrable lattice models 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section, we apply the general construction of integrable lattice
 models from branes in string theory to the simplest case of the so-called
 class 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{S}$
\end_inset

 theories.
 Taking the four-manifold to be 
\begin_inset Formula $S^{1}\times S^{3}$
\end_inset

, on which quiver gauge theories are defined, the path integral of the twisted
 partition function of the theory computes supersymmetric index.
 We first explain the correspondence between the supersymmetric index and
 the partition function of two-dimensional integrable lattice model.
 Then we proceed to the additional surface defects in the gauge theory side.
 The surface defects act on the supersymmetric index by difference operators,
 and they are identified with the transfer matrices of the corresponding
 integrable lattice model.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to give the general argument of the correspondence, let me briefly
 review the systematic brane construction of quiver gauge theories called
 
\emph on
brane tilings
\emph default
.
 For more details, the reader should be referred to [Hanany et al, Kennaway,
 Yamazaki].
 Recall the five-brane configuration given in the last part of the previous
 section (equation of D5NS5), 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
N\,\mathrm{D5} & \quad S^{1}\times M\times\Sigma,\\
\mathrm{NS5}_{i} & \quad S^{1}\times N_{i}\times\Sigma_{i}.
\end{align*}

\end_inset

For such a configuration, what one needs to notice is that when an NS5-brane
 meets 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 D5-branes, they combine to form a bound state.
 In the language of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(p,q\right)$
\end_inset

 5-branes, this bound state is either an 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(N,1\right)$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(N,-1\right)$
\end_inset

 5-brane , depending on the relative positions of the branes; see figure.
 Therefore, the extended defects 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{E}_{\mathrm{NS5}_{i}}$
\end_inset

 are domain walls in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathsf{T}_{\mathrm{D5}}$
\end_inset

 separate the spacetime into the regions with different values of the NS5-brane
 charge 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

.
 The curves 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{i}$
\end_inset

 along which these domain walls are located are known as 
\emph on
zigzag paths
\emph default
.
 Across a zigzag path the charge 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 jump by one.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Conversely, given a configuration of curves 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{i}$
\end_inset

 on the two-dimensional surface 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma$
\end_inset

 and a 5-brane charge assignment consistent with it, we can construct a
 5-brane system whose zigzag paths are 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{i}$
\end_inset

: we take 
\size normal
NS5-branes approaching the D5-branes from transverse directions, and let
 them meet along 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{i}$
\end_inset

 and form bound states over regions with 
\begin_inset Formula $q\neq0$
\end_inset

.
 Such a 5-brane system is called a brane tiling on 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma$
\end_inset

 [Hanany-Kennaway, Franco et al].
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we just explained, a brane tiling gives rise to a four-dimensional 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{N}=1$
\end_inset

 theory.
 A concrete description of this theory is known for the subset of brane
 tilings that involve only 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(N,0\right)$
\end_inset

 5-branes (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 coincident D5-branes) and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(N,\pm1\right)$
\end_inset

 5-branes.
 Given a brane tiling in this subset, we indicate 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(N,1\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(N,-1\right)$
\end_inset

 5-brane regions by dark and light shading, respectively, while leaving
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(N,0\right)$
\end_inset

 regions unshaded.
 After the shading, we get a checkerboard-like pattern on 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma$
\end_inset

 where shaded faces adjoin unshaded ones and two shaded faces sharing a
 vertex are of different types, see figure.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each unshaded region supports 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 D5-branes, hence an SU(
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

) vector multiplet lives there.
 If the region contains part of the boundary, the multiplet is frozen by
 boundary conditions and the associated symmetry is an SU(
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

) flavor symmetry; quiver notation, we represent a dynamical vector multiplet
 by a gauge node (circle) and a non-dynamical one by a flavor node (square).
 From open strings stretched between two unshaded regions (namely ending
 on 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 D5-branes partitioned by NS5-brane) sharing a vertex, we get a chiral multiplet
 that transforms in the fundamental representation under one of the associated
 gauge or flavor groups and in the anti-fundamental representation under
 the other.
 We write it by an arrow between the two nodes: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
bifundamental
\]

\end_inset

 The arrow points from the anti-fundamental side to the fundamental side.
 See figure for examples of quivers obtained from brane tilings.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moreover, for every set of zigzag paths bounding a shaded region, we have
 a loop of arrows and world-sheet instantons generate a superpotential term
 given by the trace of the product of the bifundamental chiral multiplets
 in the loop.
 The coefficient of this term is positive or negative depending on whether
 the direction of the loop is clockwise or counterclockwise.
 Thus, the four-dimensional theory realized by a brane tiling in the subset
 under consideration is an 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{N}=1$
\end_inset

 supersymmetric gauge theory described by a quiver with potential drawn
 on 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each NS5
\begin_inset Formula $_{i}$
\end_inset

 supports a U(1) flavor symmetry U(1)i.
 An arrow is charged under U(1)i if it is crossed by 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 The charge 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{i}$
\end_inset

 of U(1)i can be normalized in such a way that the arrow in (eq:bifundamental)
 has 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{i}=-1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{j}=+1$
\end_inset

.
 The diagonal combination of all U(1)i acts on the theory trivially since
 every arrow is crossed by exactly two zigzag paths from the opposite sides.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The theory also has an R-symmetry U(1)R.
 Its definition is not unique as the R-charge 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 can be shifted by a linear combination of U(1) flavor charges.
 However, the R-charge assignment is constrained by two conditions.
 The first is that U(1)R must be unbroken by the superpotential and therefore
 the R-charges of the chiral multiplets contained in each superpotential
 term must add up to two.
 The second is that U(1)R must be free of anomaly.
 This requires that for every gauge node, the sum of the R-charges of the
 arrows starting from or ending at that node must equal the number of the
 arrows minus two.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To fix the R-charge assignment, let us assume that we can orient the zigzag
 paths and bound every shaded or unshaded region with zigzag paths all heading
 upward, for some choice of the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

vertical
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 direction in the neighborhood of that region.
 This is the case for the examples in figure.
 The zigzag paths thus oriented fall into two groups; when a zigzag path
 goes upward and we cross it from the left to the right, 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 increases by one.
 We distinguish the latter case from the former by drawing the zigzag path
 with a dotted line.
 Then, we give an arrow 
\begin_inset Formula $R=0$
\end_inset

 if it originates from a crossing of two zigzag paths of the same type,
 and 
\begin_inset Formula $R=1$
\end_inset

 otherwise.
 With this R-charge assignment the two conditions describe above are satisfied
 (figure).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Summarizing the rules for assignment of the charges, we can read off the
 quiver diagram from zigzag paths as in figure.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Integrable lattice models from quiver gauge theories
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From the supersymmetric index of the four-dimensional 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{N}=1$
\end_inset

 theory realized by a brane tiling, we obtain an integrable lattice model
 defined on the lattice 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ C_{i}\right\} $
\end_inset

 consisting of the zigzag paths.
 Each 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{i}$
\end_inset

 carries a spectral parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 S-duality followed by T-duality on 
\begin_inset Formula $S^{1}$
\end_inset

 turns NS5
\begin_inset Formula $_{i}$
\end_inset

 into a D4-brane, and its coordinate on the dual circle 
\begin_inset Formula $\check{S}^{1}$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 Instead, we can apply T-duality on 
\begin_inset Formula $S^{1}$
\end_inset

 and lift NS5
\begin_inset Formula $_{i}$
\end_inset

 to an M5-brane, then 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{i}$
\end_inset

 is the coordinate on the M-theory circle.
 Either way, 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{i}$
\end_inset

 is determined by the holonomy of the U(1) gauge field on NS5
\begin_inset Formula $_{i}$
\end_inset

 along 
\begin_inset Formula $S^{1}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the theory is described by a quiver, translation between the gauge theory
 and the lattice model goes as follows [Yamazaki].
 Nodes are interpreted as spin sites.
 For each flavor node, we can turn on a holonomy of the associated gauge
 field.
 The index depends on the conjugacy class of the holonomy, which is uniquely
 represented by a diagonal matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{diag}(z_{1},\ldots,z_{N})$
\end_inset

 up to permutations of the entries.
 The index is therefore a symmetric function of the U(1)-valued variables
 
\begin_inset Formula $(z_{1},\ldots,z_{N})$
\end_inset

 obeying the constraint 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{1}\cdots z_{N}=1$
\end_inset

.
 These variables are fugacities for the SU(
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

) flavor symmetry and parametrize the value of the spin at this node, and
 thus the spins take values in the maximal torus U
\begin_inset Formula $(1)^{N-1}$
\end_inset

 of SU(
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

).
 For a gauge node, integration is performed over the fugacities since its
 gauge field is a path integral variable.
 This is the summation over the values of a spin placed on an internal face.
 Finally, arrows represent interactions between spins.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The unitarity relations are satisfied if the contributions to the index
 from arrows with 
\begin_inset Formula $R=0$
\end_inset

 are properly normalized.
 For example, consider the relation
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
unitarityrelation
\]

\end_inset

 where the right-hand side is a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

delta function
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that equates two flavor nodes when one of them is gauged.
 The theory on the left-hand side is SQCD with 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 colors and 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 flavors.
 If exhibits confinement and has a vacuum in which the mesons take nonzero
 expectation values and the flavor symmetry 
\begin_inset Formula $SU(N)\times SU(N)$
\end_inset

 is broken to the diagonal subgroup [Seiberg].
 The index computed in this vacuum is given by the right-hand side, provided
 that we cancel the contributions from the surviving baryon and anti-baryon.
 Another unitarity relation
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
anotherunitarity
\]

\end_inset

 holds since the two arrows on the left-hand side form a loop and generates
 a mass term in the superpotential.
 We can send the mass to infinity so that these arrows decouple from the
 theory, and are left with the right-hand side.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Yang-Baxter equation with three zigzag paths is harder to understand,
 as it always involves and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(N,q\right)$
\end_inset

 region with 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|q\right|>1$
\end_inset

 and a quiver description is not available.
 The problem stems from the fact that our effects are domain walls across
 which 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 changes.
 To circumvent the difficulty, we take a pair of zigzag paths of different
 types and think of it as a single line:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
doubleandsinglelines
\]

\end_inset

 This line does not alter the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

.
 Taking two copies of this line and placing them in an 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(N,-1\right)$
\end_inset

 background, we can make the R-matrix
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
R-matrix
\]

\end_inset

 A lattice model constructed from this R-matrix is a vertex model whose
 quiver consists diamonds of arrows (see figure).
 The vector space carried by a line is the space of symmetric functions
 of fugacities 
\begin_inset Formula $(z_{1},\ldots,z_{N})$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Alternatively, we can place these lines in an 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(N,0\right)$
\end_inset

 background and force them to exchange their constituent zigzag paths as
 they cross:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
anotherR-matrix
\]

\end_inset

 This R-matrix leads to an IRF model described by a quiver with triangles
 of arrows, as shown in figure.
 The corresponding Yang-Baxter equation, after cancellation of some factors
 with the help of the unitarity relation (eq:unitarity), reads
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Seibergduality
\]

\end_inset

 The two sides are related by Seiberg duality [Seiberg] for SQCD with 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 colors and 
\begin_inset Formula $2N$
\end_inset

 flavors, so their indices are indeed equal.
 The Yang-Baxter equation in the lattice model in this case is hence also
 identified with the Seiberg duality in gauge theory side.
 The Yang-Baxter equation for the R-matrix (eq:R-matrix), though more complicate
d, also follows from this equality.
 The relation between the Yang-Baxter move and Seiberg duality was pointed
 out in [Hanany-Vegh].
